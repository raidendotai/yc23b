Hello everyone! We’re
Christian
and
Eric
. We’ve been working together since 2015 when we first met as interns at LinkedIn, and we’re excited to be building Frigade. Our goal at Frigade is to make it easy to build great product onboarding so developers can spend more time building their core product experiences.
🔴 Problem: Product Onboarding is Hard
Product onboarding is essential to customer activation and retention, but building great onboarding is difficult and time consuming. We know because we experienced this problem firsthand at our previous startup where we spent enormous amounts of time building onboarding and education for our app through trial and error. Time that could’ve been spent developing our core product offering.
ㅤ
🟢 Solution: Powerful API and Open Source SDK
Frigade’s API and open source SDK take the hard work out of building and scaling great product onboarding. With Frigade, developers can:
🛠️ Quickly build beautiful onboarding within their own app UI
🔄 Ingest onboarding data from our API into their backend
⚡ Make instant changes to copy, assets, and logic via API
🎯 Easily build user targeting (powered by Segment, MixPanel, etc.)
📚 Automatically leverage built-in industry best-practices
As a result, developers can spend less time building features for product adoption and more time building the product roadmap.
Frigade SDKs
provides beautiful, extensible boilerplate for critical flows.ㅤ
