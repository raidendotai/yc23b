Hi everyone! My name is Gul and I started
Apollo Group
. Prior to starting Apollo, I was the Founder/CEO at Airlift — a q-commerce marketplace in Pakistan that raised
$120m+ in venture financing
.
💡 What We Do
Apollo currently operates as an AI lab, building LLM-powered solutions that have potential to transform entire sectors.
Our first product is Venus, an AI-powered back office that supports startups and VC funds bring efficiency, process optimisation and structure to their fundraising efforts. Our team hires, trains and deploys fully-trained business analysts to provide ongoing support with fundraising process, ranging from lead identification and pipeline management to document signing.
With Venus, while our initial focus is limited to a fundraising back office, our broader vision is to build the largest outsourcing operation in emerging markets.
💥 The Problem
As entrepreneurs that have built companies before, we cannot help but observe that fundraising processes for startups and for VC funds are highly inefficient. There is an over-reliance on serendipity and the end-to-end process is mostly run by founders or GPs (with minimal external support on process or other areas).
We believe that an outsourced virtual back office is an obvious missing piece in the fundraising toolbox for startups and VC funds alike. In the decades ahead, startups will have smaller full-time teams and a growing reliance on virtual back offices — companies will also dial up or dial down their spend on back-office services based on evolving business needs.
💪 Our Solution
Startups or VC funds can hop onto our platform, engage one of our fully-trained analysts, and then let our analyst drive the end-to-end process (from lead identification and logging to pipeline management and pre-reviewed outbound communications).
Imagine that John Smith is a founder at a startup. John can approach us and expect advanced support in the following areas:
Lead Identification & Research —
Our analyst will first fully understand the criteria for the ideal VC firm for the startup. And will then conduct extensive research in proprietary databases to identify high-relevance VC firms that you should approach.
Active Pipeline Management —
Our analyst will build, maintain and manage a pipeline for your team from start to finish. On Mondays, our analyst define the advance for the week. On Fridays, s/he follows up with the progress made. And during the week, they move target firms through the pipeline with the support and guidance from founders.
Our agents are based in low-cost environments in developing countries — this ensures that John pays a low fee for whatever he needs done.
👪 Our Customer
Our customer is a seed-stage founder that requires efficiency and operating leverage in his/her current or future fundraising processes.
