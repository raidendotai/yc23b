Dot is a chat agent that helps answer business questions on data. Data teams can focus on deep work, not on answering easy questions about dashboards.

TL;DR Instead of searching through dashboards, Dot gives you answers. It uses language models combined with data in your DWH + documentation to answer questions with SQL and data.
Hi everyone, we are Rick, Sven and Theo and we want enable everybody in your company to be able to take data and fact-based decisions.
‚ùå The Problem
Static dashboards are not good enough to keep up with changing and detailed business needs. We like a good dashboard as much as everybody. But the reality is 100s or 1000s of dashboards with way too many visualizations that try to fit to every potential business question.
‚ú® Our Solution
Ask a question, get the answer.

üö∏ Our Background
With our first product (
https://www.sled.so/
) we help teams to find, understand and trust their analytics on top of Snowflake. We learned how important it is to have trustworthy data combined with correct logic to enable great analytics.
With Dot, we build on this strong foundation and design the assistant to find and use trustworthy data. We are amazed by the out-of-the box performance of LLMs like ChatGPT and want to bring that to the next level, so everybody in a company gets a personal data analyst.
Data Analyst can then concentrate on building great data models, asking the right questions, designing processes to collect the right data, ‚Ä¶ (there is so much to do).
