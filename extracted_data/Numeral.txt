TLDR: Numeral automates sales tax compliance for ecommerce stores. We do everything from registration to remittance.
Problem
:
In 2018, the
Supreme Court ruled
that states can require out-of-state merchants to charge sales tax.
This means Shopify stores are now required to register with up to 47 state agencies and potentially submit 47 monthly filings.
Additionally, there are over 13,000 local jurisdictions, each with their own complex set of rules and rates.
In Iowa, for example, Snickers bars are taxed, while Twix bars are tax-exempt because they contain flour. ðŸ™„
The current solutions are confusing, self-serve products that offer little to no service.
Solution:
Numeral automates the entire process for ecommerce sellers. Just connect your Shopify, Amazon, or other store and we handle the rest.
Registration: We can register companies in all 47 sales tax charging states.
Monitoring: We monitor for sales tax rate changes and automatically adjust your tax settings.
Filing: Lastly, we submit tax returns & payments on your behalf.
