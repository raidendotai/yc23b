Hey YC 👋, Shahar and Tal here 🚨
We are thrilled to share Keep with the YC community today!
Keep
is an open-source alerting CLI alternative to Prometheus Alertmanager or Grafana Alerts, but for all observability tools, with a simple and intuitive (GitHub actions-like) syntax.
😫 Problem
Engineering teams are frustrated with the explosion of tools that trigger alerts. On average, engineering teams have more than five tools that generate alerts.
Using proprietary vendor alerting/monitoring products locks you into the vendor, making it extremely challenging and time-consuming to migrate at a later stage.
Vendors today require you to send/integrate all your data, which is a big overhead when all you want to do is simple alerting.
🚨 Why Keep?
Simple and intuitive (GitHub actions-like) syntax.
Declarative alerting that easily be managed and versioned in your source control and service repository.
Alerts from multiple data sources for added context and insights.
Freedom from vendor lock-in, making it easier to switch to a different observability tool if and when needed.
