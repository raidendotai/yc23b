Hi! We are Mauricio Morales and Sergio Florez, the founders of
DailyBot
.
DailyBot+ AI is a toolkit for modern work: a ChatGPT Assistant and an AI Workflow automation tool that takes asynchronous work and in-chat collaboration to another level. Compatible with Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, or Discord.
The Problem
AI is the future, yes. But many people lack the knowledge and resources to effectively incorporate AI into their daily workflow, resulting in missed opportunities for creating impactful use cases.
Our Solution
DailyBot provides a chat assistant and platform that simplifies the integration of AI into daily workflows. With our technology, anyone can access an AI assistant (ChatGPT) in the work chat, and can also implement use cases that leverage the power of AI.
We provide key building blocks for you to combine and build multiple use cases on top of your chat workspace.
The building blocks of DailyBot are:
Check-ins
for stand-ups or recurring surveys;
Forms
for any data collection;
Chat Commands
for in-chat customization;
Workflows
for setting up triggers/actions; and the
AI engine
.
The DailyBot Workflows provide a Zapier-like interface where users can define triggers and actions (one or multiple) that should run.
The Actions can be AI content generation, sending messages (DMs or channels), sending emails, or triggering other building blocks of DailyBot.
A Few Examples
You run a
Daily Stand-up
(built with Check-ins), then,
when a blocker is reported
, an
AI Workflow is run
. It analyzes the blocker and then suggests the employee ideas for solving the issue/bocker.
You create a
Form
that will be triggered with the in-chat command named ‚Äú
product release
‚Äù, when the Form is completed an
AI Workflow is run
. It analyzes all the content of the release form
and generates a press release
that is posted into the #releases channel.
You create an
anonymous survey to monitor team morale
. The
AI analyzes all the responses
and sends a summary to the head of HR (via email or DM).
We're passionate about making remote work easier and more efficient and our goal is to make DailyBot the best companion for your team‚Äôs work.
