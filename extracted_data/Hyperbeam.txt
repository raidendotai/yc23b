TL;DR: Hyperbeam lets you embed any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants, and add multi-user control with just a few lines of code.
Hey YC
👋
We’re Philip, Amby, and Declan, and we’re building

The Problem
Embedding third-party apps and websites can often be a nightmare due to incompatible platforms, security issues, and poor UX. Adding multiplayer functionality to these embeds makes this problem exponentially more difficult. This is an issue that countless remote learning, productivity, online social, and metaverse platforms face when building their products.
💡
Our Solution
Enter Hyperbeam—an API that lets you embed virtual computers anywhere, including web, mobile, VR, and even VSCode. You can then open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants, and add multi-user control with just a few lines of code.

How it Works
Sign up
on the Hyperbeam Dashboard
Generate an API key and integrate the Hyperbeam API
Customize the UX to your use case (e.g. control permissions, FPS, permitted websites, WebGL)
Launch and track your user engagement!
On the backend, we’re spinning up a VM and running a resource-optimized fork of Chromium which we then stream to participants via WebRTC. Since we’re hosting the servers running the applications, multiple users can connect and control the virtual computer seamlessly, and their client just needs to handle a video stream.
