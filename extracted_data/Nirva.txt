The Chronic illness crisis - Now or Never‚ùå
A chronic condition is a long-term health issue like diabetes, Arthritis, etc.. that doesn‚Äôt have a complete cure. The only way to deal with them is to cultivate sustainable dietary and lifestyle habits.
Chronic conditions have always been on the rise due to changing lifestyles, dietary habits, and environmental factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has only served to intensify this alarming trend, catapulting it to new heights.
To put it in perspective, Today more than
70%
of the adult population in the US report having one or more long-term health conditions that impact their quality of life and this number is rising.
Chronic illnesses account for
75% of all healthcare expenses
in the US.
Although genetics play a role, most chronic illnesses are influenced by social determinants of health, such as sleep, diet, fitness, and stress. The power to make a difference lies largely with the individual.
In order to solve this problem, we need to shift the agency. So far the agents of healthcare have been doctors, nurses, and paramedics and the venue of healthcare has been hospitals and clinics and this needs to shift. The agent has to be the individual themselves and the venue has to be wherever the individual is, the home, their office, or wherever else.
What‚Äôs the problem with Chronic condition management now?
I‚Äôll walk you through the problems of the existing approach through the
story of our clientüë©üèª
Jennifer who is a lawyer in London.
She has a busy life and started experiencing peri-menopause symptoms like gut issues and hot flashes at 50.
She took medication but they only gave her temporary relief.
The symptoms kept on coming back and this affected her family and work life causing a lot of stress for her.
Her mental health took a toll and that impacted her physical health.
She became trapped in a vicious flywheel, where her declining mental health fueled her physical deterioration, and vice versa.
Our Solution‚úÖ
Jennifer joined our program.
She received personalized Ayurvedic diet plans based on her body type. Through the program, she learned healthy diet habits and how to eat food in the right way, discovering the power of food as medicine.
Jennifer had a dedicated health coach who kept her motivated and supported her throughout her healing journey. She also did 1-1 therapeutic yoga sessions that were tailor-made for her condition. These sessions not only provided physical exercise but also helped her calm down in a way that a normal yoga session wouldn't.
In addition to this, Jennifer had access to a community of supportive women who were going through the same phase as her, creating a sense of belonging and support.
Our Nirva app helped Jennifer stay accountable to her goals through customized progress tracking. The app provided her with a gamified healing experience and helped her build sustainable dietary and lifestyle habits.
With consistent effort, Jennifer's symptoms subsided within just 3 months. She gained control over her health and her life, and we couldn't be happier to have been a part of her journey.
Our customer love is Insane-Don‚Äôt have to take our word for it. Check it out yourself.
