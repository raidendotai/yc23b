We’re Milestones, and we’re building the bridge between businesses CRM and their clients.
In 2018, Co-Founder, Manny’s wife, was in a car accident on her way to work. The injuries she suffered put her out of work for a few weeks and caused emotional trauma, so she decided to hire a lawyer to get her compensation. During the course of her legal case, she never felt like she was kept in the loop. She didn’t understand the process and always wanted more information.
When a client wants more info should they always have to reach out? Do you text Amazon to ask them where your package is at? No! We believe you shouldn’t have to text a business to see where your project is at either.
❌ A Two-Sided Problem
Clients:
In today's day and age it's typical to have all the information we want at our fingertips. Clients get frustrated because they want to know what is being worked on and what comes next.
Businesses:
Businesses are often much too busy to keep clients updated with every phase of their project. Businesses often store a wealth of information in their software, but that information is never communicated/available to clients.
🧪 Solution
Think about your interactions with various businesses:
Insurance claims
Taxes
Getting a loan
Building a house
Legal cases
Oil changes
Solar Installations
etc.
How much better would it be if there was a
Domino's Pizza Tracker-esque
interface for each one?
Milestones connects directly with a business’s CRM to automate updates and stream information back and forth. Notifications are sent to clients via text message, so that a client has easy access to the information. Clients enter the milestones application through a link in the text message. Clients and businesses can communicate back and forth through the Milestones application.
⚙️ How it works
Using API’s, a business can set up which information they want to be pushed back and forth to clients. That information includes:
Status Updates
Documents
Educational information
Calendared Events
Team Information
Etc.
Clients use SMS and the Milestones app to interact with the business.
