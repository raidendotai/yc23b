☕️TL;DR
Flowise
is an open source drag & drop tool to build your customized LLM flow.
We provide a visual interface to let you build backends for LLM apps used for QnA, summarization and analysis on your own data.
👋 This is
Henry
and
Yau
, co-founders of Flowise. We’re on a mission to make it easy for people with no-code background to learn and build AI apps.
🤔 Problem
Recent advancement of large language models like ChatGPT is revolutionizing every industry. But how do people from less tech-savvy background be able to learn it, and use it for their own use cases?
✨ Solution
Just like LEGO
🧩
, Flowise let you connect different components like PDF loader, OpenAI Embeddings, Pinecone vector database and build your own ChatGPT on your own documents. You learn as you build!
⚙️ How it works
Chatflow
Drag & drop any component to the canvas and interact with it in real-time.
API/Embed
Use the flow as an API or embed into your application.
Tool
Create your own tool and let agent automatically use it. For instance, get stock prices and add it to Airtable/Gsheets.
Extensible
Flowise is built to be extensible. Developers can easily customize their integrations by using libraries/frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace, etc.
