TL;DR
Pre-built OAuth flows & secure token management for 55+ APIs (and counting). 100% open source.
The problem: OAuth sucks.
OAuth is harder than it seems
:
Every API has specific quirks & nuances - forcing you to read endless docs pages
OAuth libraries donâ€™t solve redirects, adding callback endpoints, token storage, refresh logic etc.
When something goes wrong debugging is hard: Unspecific errors, non-compliant behaviours, missing details and a million possible root causes
On top of this, SOC 2 compliance & GDPR make storing plain-text tokens in your DB no longer a viable option.
The solution: Nango makes OAuth fast & secure.
Nango is a service that contains everything you need to work with APIs that use OAuth:
A full OAuth dance for 55+ APIs - no backend work needed
A tiny frontend SDK, with promises instead of confusing full-page redirects
Secure token storage, with automatic refresh as needed
Works with any API, programming language & framework
In your frontend easily trigger an OAuth flow with 1 line of code (full desktop & mobile support):
nango.auth('salesforce', '<user-id>'); // Opens a modal for OAuth dance
Then get always fresh access tokens in your backend:
let accessToken = nango.getToken('salesforce', '<user-id>'); // Refreshed & ready
Thatâ€™s it.
Trusted in production, by startups and established companies
Nango is used in production by companies like Typeform, Crowd.dev, AppraisalInbox, Trigger.dev (YC W23), Blocktool (YC W23) and others.
