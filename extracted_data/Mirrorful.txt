tl;dr Mirrorful is an open-source platform
for developers to create and manage a
simple design system
. Check us out on
Github

NPM package
into your project.
Hello everyone, we are Alex and Teddy, and we love making beautiful websites!
Alex

Teddy
(right) worked on the web team at Robinhood 📈. We then worked together as the first product engineers at a YC startup. At each of these companies, we consumed, contributed, and documented design systems.
🎨 Why are we building Mirrorful?
The key to consistently beautiful user experiences is design systems: a collection of reusable components and styling standards.
Design systems also speed up development — even at startups! One
test
suggests it’s
47% faster
to build a simple form using a design system. It's useful for engineers, designers, and
especially your customers
if there isn't a random color for each button in your app.
But design systems are hard to get right. Picking an out-of-the-box solution is easy to start with, but sooner than later, you run into limitations and need to do a months-long migration. On the other hand, starting from scratch is technically difficult and time-consuming.
They're also hard to maintain. Product development often moves faster than the design system itself.
Design system solutions today are bloated and introduce unnecessary friction into the product development lifecycle.
Exhibit A:
Twitter thread
on Linear's simple but efficient design system.
🎯 Our Solution
As UI engineers, we wanted a tool that:
lives in code, but is visual
easy to set up, but prepares you for scale
speeds up development, but has simple guidelines
Today, you can use install Mirrorful as a development dependency of your project to run a visual editor of your theme and then directly export your design tokens to
.js
,
.ts
,
.css
,
.scss
,
.json
. It's lightweight, with
no design system lock-in
.
Example: using CSS Variables
Example using Javascript Constants
