Hey YC! We're thrilled to announce the launch of
Cloudthread Savings Hub
, brought to you by
@Ilia
,
@Daniele
, and
@Thomas
! üéâ
TL;DR
Cloudthread Savings Hub
empowers you to identify and eliminate wasted cloud spend, streamline optimization workflows, and
maximize savings
.
Discover optimization opportunities, prioritize based on expected savings and implementation complexity, gain detailed context, group and share through Jira and Slack, track progress, and analyze realized savings.
Supports
AWS
and
GCP
.
The Problem
Despite various tools, sources, and techniques to manage cloud costs, achieving actual savings remains challenging. Many tools are expensive and charge a percentage of your total bill.
The Solution
Cloudthread Savings Hub disrupts the market by offering a combination of product and services laser-focused on eliminating cloud waste. We aggregate cost savings insights from various sources (including native cloud provider data), enrich it with valuable context, and facilitate workflow creation to effectively implement recommendations. We charge a
flat fee
for our product and a percentage of savings for service engagements.
