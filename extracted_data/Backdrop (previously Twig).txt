We eliminate receipt chasing for productions, which still rely on spreadsheets and paper receipts to manage the $650B+ they spend each year 📜

TL;DR:
We automate receipt collection and reconciliation for production companies to provide real-time visibility into cash flow and reduce time spent on expenses by at least 70% ⏰. We launched recently and we're already managing millions of spend for our first production studio 📺.

Hey everyone 👋! We are Akanksha and Caitlin and we are on a mission to build the financial infrastructure 🏦 for Film and TV productions.
Initial Problem 🚩:
Reconciliation of production expenses is extremely slow and error-prone.
10+ hours/week are wasted by each department (e.g. wardrobe) manually entering details of hundreds of receipts in Excel for reconciliation.
Production accountants also spend several hours/week manually approving each transaction and chasing people down for receipt details.
Delayed expense reports cause tax credit delays and production budget overages.
Why us?
Experience in Film + Finance + Tech 👭🏼
Caitlin grew up around film and is well connected in the movie industry. In the past, she has worked on sets where she has experienced these problems first-hand.
We have worked at leading Tech and Finance companies like Microsoft, PayPal, Uber, JP Morgan & Chase and Honey. We are passionate about bringing our expertise to the entertainment industry, where operational efficiency is much needed.
Our Solution ✅
:
Modern expensing software that seamlessly integrates with production workflows
💻
We are starting out with expensing software that integrates with local banking partners, vendors, and accounting software that productions use in each country 🌎. Through these integrations, we automatically pull receipts and when unavailable, adding receipts is as simple as texting us.
In addition to reconciliation, we collect everything productions need to quickly get their VAT refunds and tax credits back and close their books 💵.
And all this is done without changing the way they work today! 👌
Asks 🙏:
