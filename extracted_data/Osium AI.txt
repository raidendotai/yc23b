Hello everyone,
We are
Sarah Najmark
(left) and
Luisa Bouneder
(right), the founders of
Osium AI
, and close friends from Stanford University.
Our AI-powered software enables materials R&D engineers to formulate and analyze materials much faster.
Problem
To date, materials manufacturing companies rely on trial-and-error and manual approaches to develop new materials. This is a tedious and time-consuming process - at least 5 years are spent just formulating and testing in the R&D lab. Yet, the paradigm shift towards carbon neutrality by 2050 puts more and more pressure on advanced materials innovation.
Solution
We develop state-of-the-art AI technologies for materials properties predictions, inverse design of materials, and accelerated microscopy image analysis. Our product is an AI-powered software with an intuitive interface making it easy-to-use by any material R&D engineer with no data science background.
Our team
We leverage our unique combination of expertise in Materials Science and Artificial Intelligence.
We led AI research at Stanford and Google [X], authored 2 AI patents, and we have a track record in building AI products for Materials Industry leaders.
