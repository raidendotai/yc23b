Hi YC!
We're
Abhinav Das,
Aditya Bhatia,
and
Akash Bansal,
the founders of
Orangewood Labs.
Orangewood Labs
is building robotic arms for small businesses. Our mission is to democratize robots.
Orangewood‚Äôs
robots are safe, easy to operate, affordable, and capable of handling modern-day manufacturing challenges.
The Problem
Small businesses don‚Äôt have access to automation and are suffering because of it. The cost of the industry standard robotic arm is $35,000 without integration - and assuming that you need multiple robotic arms for any given function - this adds up very quickly. Companies are going out of business due to high wages and cost of living.
Our Solution
By building our own robots, we found ways to create a cheaper, more affordable robot. Our robotic arms aren‚Äôt nearly as accurate as the industry leader, but that‚Äôs okay! Not every task requires 100% accuracy. We‚Äôre currently focusing on industrial applications like pick-and-place, spray painting, and welding.
