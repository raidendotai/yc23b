Café connects teams across your organization through real-life interactions. Build authentic relationships based on interests with events, groups, and communities — all in one place.
❌ The Problem
As managers in the new hybrid world, we realized our teammates were lacking connection. It’s now harder than ever to engage with company culture and establish new relationships.
✨ Our Solution
Café prioritizes interests so that hybrid teams can discover and create communities at work. Café is where people from the entire organization connect with intention, based on their
location
,
hobbies
, and
schedule
.
⚙️ How it works
Café integrates your daily apps (like
Slack
,
Google Calendar
, and
HR tools
) so you don’t have to worry about sharing your location schedule in different places. We help teammates connect and meet up through
Events
at the office, in coworking spaces, or even in cafés!
