TL;DR
Superteam enables e-commerce businesses with action-based AI to provide instant customer service and conversational sales at a fraction of the cost.
Here is how it works:
‚ùå
The problem
Over 50% of e-commerce stores are small businesses with less than 10 employees. They struggle with customer service due to budget constraints and often lose potential customers because of slow responses and negative experiences. Larger e-commerce sites need help managing the right team size to handle thousands of customer queries during peak times.
‚ú®
The solution
We developed advanced AI models to automate critical tasks in e-commerce, such as handling customer queries, processing orders, managing payments, scheduling appointments, and providing shipping updates, and integrated them into a user-friendly admin dashboard that integrates with Shopify, allowing businesses to easily manage their orders, customers, and products while monitoring the AI's performance.
‚öôÔ∏è
How it works
The AI displays products, answers questions, handles payments, and gives shipping updates via messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram DMs, Email, and soon iMessage). This helps businesses provide value and convert leads into customers from anywhere.
