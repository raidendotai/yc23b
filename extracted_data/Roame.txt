TL;DR:
At
Roame
, our goal is to help you maximize the value of your credit card points and miles while reducing the work needed by 100x.
Credit card points and miles have become so widespread that it‚Äôs essentially an $100+ billion asset class. Yet, the process to redeem those points for outsized-valued flights is quite convoluted. Everyone wants to redeem an international first class ticket for 70K points, but few know how and the process can take up to 30 hours to fully optimize. Experts know the tricks of redeeming points, but most people, including frequent flyers, do not.

Our First Class Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo to San Francisco, booked for just 70K miles each using

(CTO)
is a full-stack software engineer. He was most recently in charge of Airbnb‚Äôs encryption services, creating and managing billions of cryptographic requests.
‚ùå Problem
Data
access is limited and fragmented for points redemptions. What you find on the travel portals are oftentimes not the best deals.
Time-consuming
to find flights and hotels to book using points. Can take up to 30 hours per trip to search across multiple loyalty programs to take advantage of complicated award redemption rules and that‚Äôs just for 1 ticket.
Underutilization
of points and miles leading to dissatisfaction and churn. Chase / Amex portals allow customers to book flights using points-to-cents value on a 1:1 to 1:1.5 ratio, whereas the true value of points can only be realized through airline partner transfers where users can find points-to-cents value ratio up to
1:25
