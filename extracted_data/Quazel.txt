David, Sam, and I (Philipp) have been hard at work to build
Quazel
, a language learning app that enables users to have natural and unscripted conversations with an AI tutor.

Problem
Right now, conversational practice gets neglected, and boring grammar and vocabulary are emphasized too much! Additionally, tailored tutoring is too expensive, cumbersome to schedule and beginners are often self-conscious about the way they talk.
Background
I faced the problem of exact issue a while ago when I started to learn Greek and thought to myself there must be a better way! To be honest, I really want Quazel for myself but seeing that other people really like it is the cherry on top 😄.
Solution
With Quazel learners are thrown into real-world scenarios where they actually need to talk. Speak into the mic & listen to AI responses. Features include:
Scene Builder - Create your own scenes & get an AI-generated image of your conversation partner!
Grammar Analysis
Built-in translator
…much more
