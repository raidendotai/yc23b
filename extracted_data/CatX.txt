CatX is the exchange for catastrophic and parametric risk, incorporating fast, automated risk origination and trading. We offer (re)insurers, investors and protection buyers sophisticated tools for risk and capital management, complemented by advanced modelling and analytics.
Our mission is to reduce inefficiencies in current risk transfer processes, while offering investors new sources of uncorrelated returns and reducing the cost of capital for protection buyers and insurers.
‚ùå The Problems:
Rising hedging and funding costs for insurers,
US property rates doubled over a six year period
Highly inefficient risk transfer markets,
with average cost ratios of 40% remaining largely unchanged despite recent technological advancements
Slow and expensive set-up and structuring processes
when issuing new insurance linked products, involving multiple parties
Little secondary market liquidity for insurance linked securities
due to their complex economics and limited availability of risk models
Poor analytics or data-drive insights
for understanding novel areas of risks
üí°Our Solution
CatX addresses these challenges by simplifying the market and providing access to world‚Äôs most advanced modelling technologies directly within our platform. In addition, we streamline the origination process, including legal setup and pricing, and offer an electronic secondary trading venue coupled with sophisticated analytics.
