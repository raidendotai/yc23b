Hey everyone, we are Dani and Ivan, software engineers whoâ€™ve lived and worked across Europe. Our mission is to help European businesses get more done and not waste time with bureaucracy.
ðŸ˜¥ Problem
Every month, small businesses in Europe spend substantial time and effort preparing paperwork and working with accountants to pay their team. Trivial tasks like giving someone a bonus require talking to your accountant weeks in advance. Making last-minute changes is impossible. For these businesses, payroll is a risky manual process with employee trust and tax compliance on the line.
Dani faced this issue when working on a side project. Every month, he had to talk to an accountant to calculate taxes, create tax forms, and get approval before paying his team. It was so slow, manual, and error-prone that he never shut up about it. Ivan had no other choice but to help him solve this.
ðŸš€A slicker way to manage your team
Slicker allows businesses in Europe to run payroll on their own. Tax and social contributions are calculated automatically, with no extra input required.
Teams can track and request time off through the employee portal. Slicker feeds PTO and other absences into the payroll process.
Slicker integrates with relevant tax authorities and helps businesses pay their teams in minutes.
ðŸ™Œ Asks
