ðŸ‘‹ Hello YC! We are
Amrutha Gujjar
and
Shivam Singhal
the founders of
Structured
.
Structured
enables the creation of intelligent agents capable of rapidly interpreting and analyzing substantial volumes of complex log data â€“ all without writing a single line of code. With the use of sophisticated language models, it efficiently identifies patterns, cross-correlates from knowledge sources (e.g. logs, metrics, customer support tickets, codebases, documentation), automates workflows, and transforms high-volume, low-density data into actionable business insights.
Why we built Structured
As ex-Facebook engineers who designed internal distributed log systems, and built machine learning detection systems for rare content, we saw first-hand how applying machine learning to these 'needle in a haystack' problems could bring about significant impact. We envisioned a solution that is not only effective but also accessible to users without a technical background. With no existing solutions meeting these criteria in the market, we decided to create our own. That's how Structured came into existence - a platform aimed to change the way you interact with, understand, and leverage your log data.
Who itâ€™s for
Structured is for any organization handling large volumes of log data and seeking to automate their log analysis to make their operations more efficient and insightful. This could include businesses in IT, cloud services, cybersecurity, data analytics, and any sector dealing with substantial volumes of log data.
