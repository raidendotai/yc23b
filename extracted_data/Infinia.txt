One API - Multi-country A2A Payments
Hi everyone!! Ianai and Alejandro here to introduce Infinia.
Infinia
makes it easy for consumer to pay by bank, and we make it easy for merchants to enable this payment method.
😩 The Problem
Unlike Europe, where there is an open banking standard and regulation, in
LATAM each country operates independently
, with different regulation and payment rail.
In addition,
cards decline rate
roughly
35% in LATAM
….
We are the first solution to put together those payment rails and create an easy way for merchants to accept frictionless
Pay By Bank across the continent
.
🤩 Our Solution
All-in-one Pay By Bank API solution:
Payment initiation services: it makes live easier for consumers to pay.
Funds confirmation: Businesses can confirm funds in real time.
Rewards program: consumers earn in store credit when they pay by bank.
Who is this for?
Merchants, apps, marketplaces, payment service providers, who operates in LATAM, and would like to save on credit card fees and offer a frictionless Pay By Bank option 🚀!!
