Hi everyone! We -
Wael
and
Kenan
- are building a platform for retailers to match their invoices with their purchasing orders.
The Problem: Retailers are overpaying their vendors
Retailers are juggling a lot of internal and market pressures­–inflation, low margins, high turnover, etc. They don’t have the time and resources to stay on top of their entire operations. As a result, we discovered that they can’t keep track of the discrepancies between purchase orders and vendor payments, leading them to routinely overpay their vendors.
Solution: Martola, automatic matching between your invoices and purchase orders
Martola requires minimal intervention on the retailer’s side, matching the necessary lines on their purchase orders to their invoices and alerting them to discrepancies such as price and quantity mismatch.
Retailers can follow up with the vendor or update the purchase order on their end.
We decided to focus on solving this critical pain point as our initial scope. Our long-term vision is to capture retailers by solving for this problem with a clear business case and expand our product suite to address retailers’ other challenges.
Our ask
