Tl;dr:
Finance teams spend 75% of their time on manual processes, and existing tools in the market are extremely difficult to adopt. Glade is a user-first, fully integrated platform that helps enterprises and scaling companies streamline their financial planning, reporting, and analytics. Check out our

Hi everyone, we’re Daniel and Aaron, the co-founders of Glade!
🧨 Problem: Financial Planning is Painful and Tedious
Within growing companies and enterprises, there is no single source of truth for financial data, and finance teams are wasting too much time on manual tasks. Daniel was a finance manager at his last company and spent hours every day manually preparing data and handling simple requests from business partners.
Existing tools are also extremely difficult to adopt and implement. Daniel’s previous company implemented Anaplan and paid hundreds of thousands each year for it, yet only one person in his entire company learned how to properly use it.
🚀 Solution: A User-First, AI-Powered Financial Platform
Glade helps companies build, manage, and visualize their financial plan in real-time.
Unlike existing enterprise tools, we fully integrate with all business apps (such as Netsuite, Workday, and Snowflake) to automate the flow of data directly from these apps to your team’s Google Sheets and Excel models. Through our integrations and data enrichment, Glade serves as the central source of truth for all financial data within a company.
Our platform also empowers leaders across the company to make informed decisions and stay aligned. By leveraging AI, we allow users to self-serve financial data through our platform and use natural language to create custom, board deck-ready visualizations in seconds. Want to check how your business is performing in the APAC region? Just ask Glade: “How has my revenue trended in APAC over the last 3 months?” Using AI, we will produce a high-quality chart for you in seconds.
Using Glade, companies:
✔️ Speed up financial planning, month-end close, and investor/board deliverables by 2x
✔️ Improve reporting and forecast accuracy by eliminating errors from manual data pulls
✔️ Align leaders and teams across the company to financial objectives
💲Opportunity Size:
The total addressable market for enterprise financial planning is $50B. Anaplan is a leader in the space, with a market capitalization of almost $10B.
However, with a recorded NPS of -38 and poor user adoption across its customers, legacy enterprise tools like Anaplan are bound to be replaced.
