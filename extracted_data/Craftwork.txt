Craftwork
is a home painting company that builds software to make it easy for homeowners to book and manage their home painting projects. We then deploy trained, full-time employees to paint our customers‚Äô homes.
The Problem
Today, it‚Äôs hard for homeowners to locate and hire home service providers, because contractors don‚Äôt use technology and rely on outdated employment models to operate their businesses.
As a result, the process for homeowners to complete any home project is riddled with challenges - from tediously searching for a reputable contractor, to coordinating multiple walkthroughs of their home, reviewing quotes, selecting a provider, agreeing to terms, scheduling the work, and enduring price and timeline changes before the work is finally completed - each step is frustratingly manual, unpredictable, and outdated.
The Solution
At Craftwork, our coupling of a vertically integrated business model with best-in-class software allows us to deliver an unparalleled experience to homeowners.
Our unique approach puts homeowners in control - from getting an estimate online with transparent pricing, to scheduling their projects and exploring our color selection tools, to meeting the team that will paint their homes and understanding what to expect when we arrive - we‚Äôre establishing a standard of transparency, accountability, and trust that simply can‚Äôt be matched.
As homeowners we‚Äôve experienced first-hand just how difficult it can be to hire quality contractors. We believe that by building software to simplify the homeowner experience and streamline internal operations, we‚Äôll disrupt the $500B+ home services market and grow to become the largest residential general contractor in the country.
The Team
We‚Äôre all former founders and early-stage team members with experience successfully scaling operations-heavy technology startups.
