TLDR: Traditional automation software is slow and expensive, Automat is 10X faster and 1/10th the price. It lets operations teams automate using natural language.
Howdy y’all! Lucas here from
Automat
- excited to share what my cofounder Gautam and I have been working on!
🧐 The problem: Traditional Robotic Process Automation is slow and expensive.
It’s extremely time consuming and expensive to build out robot process automations using traditional tools like UiPath (~$66,000 per yearly license - Yikes!) not to mention the initial consultant setup fees which most people are forced to pay if they don’t have the resources in house (at the lowest end we’re talking $50,000+ per project - Double Yikes!!)
💡
Our Solution: Automat makes it 10X cheaper and faster to build any robotic process automation using natural language on chrome.
We’re solving this by creating a platform that enables robotics process automation for Chrome using large language models and computer vision.
Currently our customers send us descriptions or videos of the processes they’d like us to automate and we use our internal tooling to quickly build out those automations.
Here is one of our customer’s attended bots in action, scraping an email, looking through a prospecting tool, and saving it to a spreadsheet.
We want to let anyone regardless of timeline or budget automate the work they do by using natural language or simply sending Automat the workflow in a screen recording.
👯 A little more about us
Gautam and Lucas met on the first day of Design school at Carnegie Mellon University and have been roommates ever since:
At Google, their team was tasked with finding product applications of
LaMDA
in early 2020, and they built over 50+ prototypes integrating LaMDA across Google’s products and services. Eventually Gautam would go on to implement multiple demos for Google’s
first public Demonstration of LaMDA
, the AI test kitchen.
They were hired together at Google’s Creative Lab as part of the
Creative Lab 5
, at Google they spent the following three years launching products like the
AI Test Kitchen
,
Everyday Helper Robots
,
Teachable Machine
, the
Google Pixel Buds Pro
, and most importantly a
high speed lucky charms cereal sorter
🍀
At Carnegie Mellon they studied Human Computer Interaction and Design. During their Junior year they created an adorable
AI robotic assistant
that caught Google’s attention which awarded them a grant during their senior year to
research Robotics and AI
.
