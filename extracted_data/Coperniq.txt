What’s up YC 👻 , Max & Abdullah here - co-founders of
Coperniq
(W23).
🏃‍♂️ TL;DR
Coperniq is workflow software for solar & energy contractors. It cuts soft cost per installation by
$3K (17% of total cost)
& accelerates projects by
45 days (30% of project timeline)
.
It automates the entire workflow so contractors can focus on growing their business & helping more homeowners go solar 😎☀️
🤯 Problem
Abdullah used to work in the solar industry, first in the sales department, and later in operations management.
He witnessed first-hand that while
“going solar”
was a no-brainer and took consumers 5 minutes, the process of getting a solar system
turned on
was a nightmare for companies and customers alike, taking 6-9 months instead of the promised 90 days.
This is because despite being one of the most important industries of our lifetime, solar is in the dark ages technologically. Bloated Salesforce instances, spreadsheets with 300+ columns, and pencil-and-paper workflows in the field…
This results in project managers working 60-hour weeks, human error & delays at every step of the process, and some of the
worst customer experience
in the entire home improvement sector.
💡 Solution
Coperniq is the first industry-specific platform for the underserved energy workforce. It helps…
1. Finish projects faster and cheaper
Our platform cuts up to 25% of soft costs, allowing contractors to deploy more projects, faster, and cheaper; with 5-star customer experience
every time
.
2. Turn costly (often unprofitable) service calls into a revenue engine
By integrating with hardware OEMs (Enphase, SolarEdge, etc…), Coperniq gives you real-time health checks for your install base, automates service tickets, & drives referral revenue.
