Hey everyone! Weâ€™re Ravi & Narahari from the402
the402 helps creators monetize their superfans through livestreams and NFTs
For example, an artist can perform new songs on a private livestream and superfans attend by buying an NFT
Since launching a little over a month ago, each artist on our platform is
averaging around $700 / livestream
One creator made ~$1.3k from one livestream
On Twitch he streams 16 times a month to make ~$250
Problem:
My co-founder Narahari is a top 3% Twitch streamer. He grew frustrated that he had fans who wanted to pay more but didnâ€™t have an easy way to do so
Current platforms are great for creators to get mass distribution, but they hardly make money off their content alone
There are superfans/patrons that have an extremely high willingness to pay, but donâ€™t have a great mechanism to do so (even on Patreon, only 2% of the users make more than minimum wage)
How it works:
Create an NFT access pass for a livestream and/or use existing NFTs to gate your livestream
The NFT issued is liquid with dynamic pricing using our protocol, which allows there to be a market created around the stream
Fans can purchase an NFT either with crypto or credit card
Once the livestream starts, those who hold the NFT have access to the livestream & can interact with the creator / each other
You can also stream for free and monetize through NFT sales, auctions, or emotes during the livestream
Abstracting away crypto:
Even though weâ€™re using NFTs to serve as the access pass, we abstract this away with optional credit card payments
The end consumer just needs to know that theyâ€™re buying a digital ticket that gives them access to a livestream
So why NFTs/crypto? Whatâ€™s the crypto use case here:
NFTs allow for a global market to be spun up around a creator/event easily
Decentralized access control - NFTs can be used for multiple use cases independent of the platform they were bought on (i.e. you can gain access to another livestream, redeem for an IRL concert, access to private discord, special merch etc.)
The relationship between fan & creator becomes P2P + tied to your digital identity
Proof of fandom / patronage can be flexed
Existing tokens can be used permissionlessly to gate content
Asks:
