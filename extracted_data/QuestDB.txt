TL;DR
QuestDB Cloud
, a fully hosted time-series database, is now Generally Available. We offer $200 free credits for new signups.
Try the QuestDB Live Demo
with billions of rows that you can query with SQL.
The Problem
Existing time-series databases such as InfluxDB lack performance (especially for high cardinality datasets) and are hard to use (proprietary languages like Flux).
Do you use Postgres, MySQL or MongoDB and outgrow the database for time-series and analytics? Databases not purposely built for time-series data can struggle with ingestion and query performance.
The Solution
How does it work?
QuestDB has been built from scratch for time-series data workloads. The data is natively indexed by timestamp and partitioned by time. Queries can be done via SQL, and there are several time-series SQL extensions for time interval searches, downsampling, latest record etc.
QuestDB ingestion speed can reach up to 4M rows/sec per instance, and queries over a billion-row dataset can be executed in milliseconds. This performance translates in:
-       Lower hardware requirements + cost savings.
-       Capability to handle high throughput ingest from multiple sources
-       Reactive applications and real-time dashboards
QuestDB Cloud
brings new features such as:
-       Security: TLS, Auth, SSO
-       Data Compression: 3x - 5x lower storage costs
-       RBAC: Create roles and permissions at a column level (imminent release)
-       High Availability (Coming soon!)
-       Cold Storage integration (Coming soon!)
Our ingestion protocol is the InfluxDB Line Protocol: easy switch from InfluxDB.
It also supports the Postgres Wire Protocol and is compatible with Grafana, Superset, Telegraf, Kafka, Flink, Spark, Cube, MindsDB.
