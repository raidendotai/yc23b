Problem:
Posture impacts the way we think, look, feel, and act. Unfortunately, most of us spend the majority of our workdays hunched over a computer, leading to back and joint pain, headaches, and even long-term heart disease.
How Zen AirPods Can Help:
Real-time Slouch Alerts -
Zen uses the motion sensor in your AirPods (3rd generation, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, Beats Fit Pro, and other headphones that can send motion data to your iPhone) to mirror your posture in real-time and gently alerts you (via phone vibration, audio alert, and/or a message notification), whenever you‚Äôre slouching for an extended period of time.
Background Mode
- Zen runs completely in the background. With Background Mode you can get slouch alerts even when your phone is locked or if you‚Äôre using another app.
Zen can still send you gentle slouch alerts (via phone vibration, audio alerts, and/or a message notification). You can completely customize your Zen experience.
ZenInsights - Get detailed posture insights, including a posture score. See how much you‚Äôre Upright vs. Slouching throughout the day.
Posture & Workstation Tips - Learn how to sit and stand in comfort, get WFH office product recommendations, and more.
