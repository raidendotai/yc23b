Rivia.AI
helps sales and marketing teams to create interactive video demos for their product with zero engineering effort.
Check out the sample demo
Problem
For a lot of products, it’s super difficult for the prospects to understand how the product solves their problem
Product videos are the most commonly used solution but they don’t help prospects really experience the product.
Click-through demos aren’t engaging because prospects have to go through a lot of text and drop off quickly (or worse, click next without reading).
Solution
We have combined the best of both worlds. Using
Rivia.AI
, you can add a Loom-like personal explanation of your product while maintaining its interactivity.
Just clone your product using our chrome extension.
Record loom-like videos on top of your clone using the
Rivia.AI
editor.
Share instantly using a link or embed the demo on your website.
