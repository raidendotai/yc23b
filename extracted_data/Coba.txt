Coba
allows international knowledge workers in Mexico to deposit their USD paychecks in US accounts and spend in pesos. One account…two currencies.
Hola 👋 ! We are the team behind Coba.
🤔 The Problem
International knowledge workers earn in USD but live their day-to-day in Pesos. Moving money across borders is costly, complex and the existing banking infrastructure is slow. On average, a knowledge worker will lose $1,000 per year in hidden ForEx and transfer fees. In that process, their money will touch at least 3 different accounts adding time and steps along the way.
💡 The Solution
Coba is the app where users can:
Access a single account to deposit their payroll, save in USD and send funds to Mexico.
Transfer Mexican Pesos to local bank accounts in seconds without fees and at competitive FX rates.
Receive a local credit card for daily expenses in Pesos that draws from their USD balance.
Earning and saving in USD… Living and spending in Pesos.
🇺🇸💸🇲🇽 How Do We Do It?
Trust
: Coba runs on existing, regulated banking infrastructure and tools
Convenience
: A single app for two currencies
Efficiency
: Proprietary payment rails mean more competitive FX rates and savings for our Users
🇺🇸💸🇲🇽 Why Us?
From the Near-shoring capital of Latin America, Monterrey, MX, we live a cross-border reality. Not only have we employed remote teams across LatAm in the businesses we have operated, but we are remote workers ourselves and know first-hand the costs and complexity of moving money from USD to Pesos.
🙏 The Ask
If you currently have employees or friends in Mexico who are earning in USD and could benefit from an account, we would love to have them as early adopters. They can sign-up for our priority waitlist
