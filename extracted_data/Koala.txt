🧠 “Play is our brain’s favorite way of learning.”
Right?
But for kids, live online classes feel like
That’s why we co-founded
Koala
.
A fun alternative to Zoom for kids’ online classes. It looks like this:
Inspired by Minecraft, Koala quickly attracted thousands of teachers and their students. Kids and teachers loved it.
💚 Our community of teachers helped us iterate fast on our MVP
🥳 We got into YC W22
🥇 Koala won awards
🔥 Today, we’re launching our new product: Learn with Koala
Fun live online classes you can book for your kids with the best teachers.
Our 3 favorite classes:
Introduction to Chinese
