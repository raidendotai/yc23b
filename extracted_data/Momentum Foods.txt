TL;DR
At
Momentum Foods
, we’re adding meat back into plant-based meat to make it more affordable, healthy, and delicious.
Overview
After five years developing and scaling textured protein (the base of every product) at Beyond Meat, I realized two things:
Plant-based meat companies don’t have a clear path to improving product quality
and
decreasing cost.
The 96% of the population that regularly eats meat cares more about cost, health, and flavor than whether their food is vegan.
By combining plant protein with the best parts of meat, we can finally make a product that’s less expensive than the real thing, but nearly indistinguishable from it — all while being better for the planet.

Team (more than just mustaches)
I (
Saba
) spent the past five years heading up the R&D engineering department at Beyond Meat, where I helped develop and scale the textured proteins that underpin every product introduced to the market since 2017.
Brice
was the fourth engineer at the vertical farming company Plenty and developed the base of their technology before shifting to lead the commissioning of their multimillion dollar LA farm. We met our freshman year at Stanford then both went on to get bachelor’s and master’s in mechanical engineering, completing much of the coursework together.
