Hello all! We are
Zach
,
Alvaro
and
Fernando
and we are proud to officially launch
DolarApp
- your international USDc account for Mexico, where you can
Get your Mexican account in Dollar USDc and save with 3% APY
Have your own US bank account details (ACH and Routing Number) and get paid without hassle
Receive 4% cashback whenÂ  you pay with your card locally and internationally - without hidden fees
Why did we build DolarApp?
The three of us have spent a lot of time in Latin America and made great friends there. Friends who, simply because of where they were born, see their financial freedom limited: hyperinflation, bans on saving in USD, nightmares trying to move money in/out of their country and crazy fees when paying with a card when traveling.
After spending a couple of years at Revolut, we learned that Fintech as we know it today is constrained by traditional financial systems, partners, and regulatory frameworks. We realized we could end those constraints by offering people in LatAm a better account for their everyday finances built on USDc, with focus on simplicity and away from typical crypto jargon and complexity.
