Hello there!
This is Luis, Camilo, Chris and Ivan from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. We are happy to share that Littio is live!
ðŸš€
Littio
is a
dollar bank
tailored made for people in Latin America to fight devaluation.
Why we started this
300 million people in Latin America have no way of accessing basic financial services in U.S. dollars. We are financially cut off from the world. Access to dollar financial products is limited to the richest 1% and only them can effectively protect their money from hyper-devaluation.
Having lived this problem first hand for years, we want to fundamentally change the dynamics. People should have access to global financial services in dollars via technology.
Our Solution
A dollar bank account that works from an app on any smartphone. With Littio people can:
Open a free dollar bank account in less than 3 minutes ðŸ’µ
Get a Mastercard debit card ðŸ’³
Send and receive dollar payments ðŸ’¸
We use USDC and traditional payment railways to power up this solution in a simple and easy experience for users.
Finally,
If you live in Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ and want a dollar account, download our app at
Apple
or
Google
.
If you live in any other country in LatAm, send us an email at
founders@littio.co
and we can set you up.
