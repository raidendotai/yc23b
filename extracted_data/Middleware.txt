Hey YC! 👋
I am super excited to launch
Middleware
—a
real-time observability platform
that brings all the
metrics, logs, traces, and events
into a single timeline so you can monitor your distributed apps and cloud native platforms in real time.
Problem with existing legacy products
Current observability solutions are built to monitor monolith architectures, not distributed and microservices. This results in the following problems:
Surface-level information makes it
extremely hard to debug
issues. 🧐
Costs 💵 to monitor everything in the infrastructure and applications are
incredibly high
.
All the data live in separate apps like logs, metrics, traces, and events and can’t
correlate to causation
.
Because cloud native produces more data than ever, it’s become more challenging to understand what’s happening inside applications and infrastructure. Unfortunately, the result often
wastes engineering time
tracking incidents, creates alert fatigue, and, yes, costs a fortune.
Why we founded Middleware
I faced this problem when building my last startup. While building out the backend, it was
challenging to monitor microservices and Kubernetes
, as there was no all-inclusive cloud monitoring tool available.
My few early engineers from
Splunk
and
Newrelic
faced this problem as well. After speaking to engineering and IT leaders at several other companies—and they were facing the same problem—we started to work on Middleware full-time.
Our solution to cloud native observability
Middleware is a
real-time observability platform
for cloud-native, microservices, and distributed apps that brings all the metrics, logs, traces, and events to a
single timeline
. This empowers
dev and ops teams
to find and debug issues faster.
Additionally, our
AI-powered algorithms
collect and analyze data from across your entire infrastructure to spot signs of potential problems before they even occur.
Middleware offers a wide range of observability from
infrastructure
monitoring,
logs
monitoring, application performance monitoring (
APM
),
synthetic
monitoring,
database
monitoring, and real-time
alerting
solution with cost-effective prices.
What our customers say about us!
Cliff from
Puresend
- "
We migrated from Datadog to Middleware because we absolutely love their unified view. It's such a simple but incredibly useful tool. This, among other features, made it a no-brainer for us to migrate. We monitor our logs, metrics, and traces at a very affordable cost. I highly recommend Middleware as the best in class for cloud-native monitoring.
"
Eduardo from
Berliner Philharmoniker
- “The Digital Concert Hall only uses cutting-edge technology, and Middleware was able to provide that with its all-in-one monitoring solution and near real-time metrics.”
Reinventing observability for the future 🔮
Our mission is to change how companies
observe infrastructure and applications
cost-effectively. Our tools provide everything you need to
remediate issues
faster while getting observability data growth under control. It provides real-time insight into your cloud-native infrastructure, applications, and business.
Vendor agnostic by using and contributing to
Open Telemetry
.
Store only the data that you need to save on
costs.
💰
Correlate the traces from the
browser to the front end and back end
with logs and metrics.
Using
AI to predict
any anomaly and possible downtime.
