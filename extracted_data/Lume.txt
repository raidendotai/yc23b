Hi everyone! We are Nicolas, Nebyou, and Robert, the founders of Lume. We are on a mission to empower companies to focus on delivering their core value proposition rather than spending time on data integrations and transformations.
🧨 Problem
Engineers spend countless hours manually transforming data for custom integrations or pay large amounts to consulting firms to do the same. Dynamic schemas from different clients or apps require engineers to build and maintain custom integration pipelines one by one, and companies spend days, weeks, and even months building integrations. Lume is tackling this problem head-on.
✨ Solution
Lume uses AI to automatically transform data between
any
start and end schema and pipes the data directly to your desired destination. Lume provides this through a no-code platform where you can build and maintain your custom data integrations. Whether you want to map multiple sources to your internal unified schema or connect to your third-party apps without manual mapping, Lume delivers. With automated transformations and data delivery, backtesting and data quality checks, and version control, engineers can spend more time delivering their core value to customers instead of wrangling and manually mapping data.
⚙️ How it works
You connect your custom schemas and authenticate into your desired apps.
Lume’s AI system creates the transformations between any two schemas, ranging from internal schemas to structured third-party apps.
Once you validate the transformed data, Lume will pipe the correct data to your specified destination.
We can connect to your data warehouse and leverage its compute to keep your data in-house.
Common Use Cases:
Internal: Transforming separate data sources into one unified internal ontology
Ex: a unified schema between Salesforce, Hubspot, Quickbooks, and Pipedrive.
External: Custom syncs between your SaaS apps
Ex: Enrich CRM data from multiple sources before sending it to your BI tool
Onboarding: Mapping prospective client data to fit your product’s input schema
Ex: Consulting firms mapping each new clients’ unique ERP schemas to their internal ontology on Snowflake.
Migration: Creating custom integration pipelines between competitor products to yours
Ex: New productivity tool startup creates an “Import from Notion/Evernote” for newly converted users.
