Hi everyone, we’re Juliet, Austin, Michael, and Michael. We’re the team behind
Procoto
. We’re on a mission to make procurement software more accessible and affordable for everyone.
tl;dr:
Procoto makes running RFPs, tracking contracts, and managing vendors simple and affordable. We get procurement teams out of dense systems and spreadsheets without having to drop a hefty check on SAP or Coupa.
And it’s self-service! No sales calls, redlines, or lengthy implementations. Snag our
YC launch offer
to get started!
😤 The problem with procurement software
Small and mid-market companies face the same sourcing, contract, vendor, and spend management challenges of larger organizations, but with fewer resources and without the funds for an enterprise procurement platform.
RFPs are conducted with spreadsheets and emails
Time is wasted searching for, selecting, and inviting vendors to bid
Contract terms, vendor information, and spend data are spread across systems
Person hours are dedicated to data management rather than securing better rates
Historical bidding and pricing disappear after the RFP
The alternative solution today is a six-figure annual agreement with one of the big boys
😇 How we’re fixing it
Procoto eschews (bless you) the complexity and the feature bloat of enterprise procurement software. We keep it simple and user-friendly in a tool built for everyone. Procoto automates the collection of RFP, contract, and vendor information into a centralized system and highlights savings opportunities based on historical data.

🤡 Why us?
We built procurement organizations at a couple of startups and have used 30+ of our competitors’ software. We lived the pain we’re solving for years and finally left to build the solution we couldn’t find Something self-service, customizable, with UI/UX from this decade, and built for users without supply chain degrees.
🙏🏻 Our ask

Hospitality
Restaurants
Apartment groups
PEs that manage any of the above
