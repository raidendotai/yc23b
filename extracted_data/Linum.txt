🎞️ What is Linum?
Linum is Midjourney for video, a creative tool that allows anyone to make animated videos starting with just a few prompts.
For example, Linum generated this video in 5 minutes. (4K Version Here).
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who are we?

🔨 Why are we building this?
When we shuttered our last venture in the fall of 2022, we fell down the AI Art rabbit hole like so many others. We LOVE movies, so we immediately found ourselves trying to make animated videos using diffusion models.
Turns out it’s really hard to do — so we’re building the models and tools to make it easier.
