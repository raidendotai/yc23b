Hey everyone, we're Ann and Yan, and we're on a mission to make remote collaboration feel like working side by side again:
—
❌ The Problem
While screen sharing is good for 1-to-many presentations when you just want the participants to sit and listen, it’s inefficient when you want people to participate actively to get stuff done or learn a workflow remotely:
😩 Switching presenters require upfront coordination and always wastes a few minutes.
😩 As an observer, you cannot just jump in and point out details. And verbally directing where the presenter should click on or navigate to can feel frustrating.
😩 As a presenter, you cannot tell whether people are engaged or what they are engaging with. Sometimes you can feel like you’re speaking into the void.
✨ Our Solution
Berry is a chrome extension that allows you to instantly share, co-browse and collaborate with others on any website with real-time shared cursors.
✅
Switch presenters
in 1 click and co-drive a session smoothly
✅ Know precisely what content everyone is engaging with as if you are sitting side by side
✅ Command attention instantly by
summoning
everyone to where your cursor’s at
✅ Work in your own browser with 0 latency and crisp text
🫵 Use Cases
👩‍💻 Customer Onboarding & Training:
Show customers how your product works directly in their browser. Observe where they stumble and jump in to help. Scroll and click for them as if you are sitting side by side.
🎯 Internal Team Collaboration:
Plan projects and review briefs in Notion. Groom development tasks in Jira. Review Marketing campaigns in Google Analytics. Co-browse through competitor’s website.
🎓 New Employee Training:
Ramp up your employees to use work software effectively with a hands-on training session. Easily show them how to do multi-step workflows across tools e.g. Research leads on Linkedin and import it to Salesforce
