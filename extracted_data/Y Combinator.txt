Hello,
Oliver
and
Zach
here, software engineers at Y Combinator. We are thrilled to announce YC Deals.
Employees at YC companies can now leverage one of the major benefits previously only available to YC founders –
YC Deals
. Through YC Deals, employees have access to more than 100 discounts and exclusive offers on industry leading tools. There are already $500,000 worth of free credits and discounts available, and new deals are constantly being added.
❌ The Problem
We built YC Deals for our companies with a growing team. The founders still want to take advantage of the wide variety of discounts and free credits that YC companies receive, but their employees don’t have access to Bookface (our internal platform for YC founders), where these exclusive deals are listed.
✨ Our Solution
Now any employee of a YC company can redeem these deals and help their company save money. Building something new? There are dozens of dev tools like PostHog, Fivetran, and OneSignal.  First HR or ops hire? Get Deel and Stable up and running at a discount. In charge of security? Check out Vanta.  Also find deals on startup staples, like Gusto, GitHub, Algolia, and Amplitude. Help build and grow your company using world-class tools on a startup budget.
👉 Next steps
Employees at YC companies can access YC Deals by completing a simple email verification flow using their company email address
