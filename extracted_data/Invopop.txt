Hey YC! 👋
We are Sam and Juan, co-founders of
Invopop
, and we are on a mission to simplify Sales Tax/VAT compliance, globally.
🧨 The problem: new sales reporting requirements
Tax authorities around the world are starting to require that companies report
every sale
, in
real-time
for tax recording purposes. Yes, every
single transaction,
in real-time (i.e.
electronic invoicing
)
This is
already required
in most
LatAm
countries and India, and the majority of
European countries
are making it mandatory in the next
1-3 years
.
🎉  Our solution: one API, global compliance
Our API receives the information of a
sale in a simple open-source format
and
converts it to a locally-compliant invoice,
including
Sync with tax authorities reporting requirements (e-invoicing).
Generate a custom-branded PDF invoice and send it to customers.
Integrate with the company’s stack (e.g. ERP, billing, payments, reconciliation).
Invopop is already live in
Colombia, Spain & Portugal
. Many more coming soon: Mexico, Italy, Peru…
🚀 Why we built Invopop
Sam
was previously
co-founder & CTO of Cabify
, and as they expanded to LatAm, complying with the e-invoicing requirements became a nightmare. As he could not find a global provider to solve this, he built Invopop.
Juan
worked as a
consultant in Mexico
and was blown away by how complex the e-invoicing system was. When he learned this is becoming mandatory in Europe, he knew Invopop was needed!
