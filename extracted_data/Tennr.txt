Hi everyone, we’re Tyler, Diego and Trey — the team behind
Tennr
!
TL;DR
We’re making it easy for non-technical businesses to bring custom, fine-tuned LLMs into their business.
🧐 The problem
Today, teams choose between using simple, ChatGPT-based AI use-cases or investing heavily in their own ML teams to build their own models.
If you’re building an LLM from scratch, you have to:
Find clean, expansive data
Generate thousands of prompt-response pairs
Use RLHF to improve outputs
Host your own GPUs
Build your own analytics
Engineers and IT teams need to stay focused on their core functionality and can’t risk 6 month long dev projects that might not even result in a well-performing LLM.
💡
Our solution
Tennr is a platform that makes it easy to train, tune, and deploy custom Large Language models without needing support from engineering.
💥
How it works
We use proprietary techniques to turn a company’s document set into clean data that can train an LLM. Then, leveraging open source foundational models, Tennr automatically fine-tunes to support your ideal use-case. Finally, through Tennr, non-technical teammates can improve responses, make corrections, and monitor how their LLM is being used.
📚
