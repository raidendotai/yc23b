TL;DR
JustPaid.io
is the AI-powered controller you wish you had earlier, so you will never have to worry about overpaying bills again.
Problem
Companies' current financial processes are disconnected from what you
agreed
to pay vs. what you were
actually
charged, even when your vendor makes a billing error. This is what we’re here to resolve.
On average, United States businesses lose over $300,000 per year alone from invoice fraud totaling $12B. Don’t be a statistic.
With expanding teams, a lot of vendor workflows are stuck in Slack and inboxes.  We are automating workflows to successfully manage vendors, including contracts, projected spend, W9/W8BEn collection, payment approval and remittance.
Solution
Saving thousands of dollars in real-time overview of your usage and billing,
JustPaid.io
provides a centralized experience to automate and manage vendor relationships, overspending, and more to ensure no matter the stage of your organization, you are always in control.
We collect data from your contracts all in one dashboard and compare it to both your historical as well as ongoing spend. We work with your existing bill payment solution or you can leverage our multi-approval workflow.
Backstory
Our backstory is founded on personal experience that is often shared by many in the YC Community:
“
My firm and I were handling all the bookkeeping, accounting and controller functions for over 1,000 startups in the past 10 years. It’s the same issues with the lack of workflow. There is always the same persistent disconnect of management and finance teams. Endless emails between so many stakeholders due to the contract negotiation process with no meaningful control when the bill is due. Additionally, collecting W9/W8BEN forms, and setting up payment accounts.”

“As a second-time founder, I know it can be a burden to keep a daily eye on spend, yet it is a necessary part of running a successful startup looking into what is owed and what is paid. I wanted to create a tool I wish I had that gave real-time financial insights. Founders and their teams need a copilot providing a usable dashboard to make them certain about cash flow visibility into their company, giving financial insights real-time.”

“I want every founder out there to have accurate financial information at their fingertips so that every employee can feel secure.”
