The Problem 🚩
Companies have three ways of getting phone calls to and from remote, hybrid, and offsite workers:
They can give their employees a
costly second handset
📱📱
They can require that their employees use their
personal number for work
calls, hitting their privacy (and possibly regulatory requirements)🕵️
They can persevere with a
legacy office phone system
, with the configuration difficulties and poor quality mobile apps that come with it 📟 - on top of a 50% typical missed call rate.
In all of these cases, companies struggle to understand user behaviour and performance, and they risk customer loss if an employee leaves.
The Devyce Solution⚗️
Devyce customers use a portal to instantly allocate (and deallocate) numbers to employees, auto-attendants and call groups. They see calling stats and have the option to record calls and view a detailed call history.
Our monthly charge of around
$20 per user
is significantly lower than the price of a second handset.🪙
Users can be given
one or many mobile or landline numbers
instantly, from the UK, several European countries, and the US. 🌍
Our product is designed for
mobile first
, and our apps get fantastic
App Store
and
Play Store
reviews. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Our Magic Beans 🪄
Devyce has a close relationship with a UK mobile network operator. This not only gives us unbeatably low call costs (we’re paid to receive calls), but as we are expanding it lets us overcome regulatory issues in territories outside the UK.
Our tech’s second to none. We’re not just building a phone system, we’re redefining what it does. With
automated call summarization, CRM integrations and smart call routing
all in development we’re delighting both our customers
and their customers
. We’re reducing the number of missed calls, which means our customers get more sales opportunities and win twice by switching to us.
Our Story 📖
Nick’s background is in investment banking. However, while studying for his qualifications, he dabbled briefly in both real estate and recruitment. This gave him an insight into the pain points faced by both of those phone-intensive businesses, something that stayed with him until the opportunity to fix it arose.
Ed graduated from Cambridge with a Computer Science degree in 2004. He worked for some of the most selective London tech companies such as Softwire and G-Research, before moving to Vietnam for a few years and doing some freelance mobile development (as well as dabbling in VoIP).
We met through a mutual friend, Leo Bartle, who owns the aforementioned UK mobile network. Leo’s turned that network around from near bankruptcy, and it now supplies numbers to companies such as Salesforce and Google. He runs the mobile network day-to-day, and works closely with us through that as an increasingly active co-founder.
Get Devyce
We’ve been selling for a year and a half, so our core telephone offering is reasonably mature and stable. You can sign up via
our website
for our multi-user packages, but if you want a
second UK mobile number instantly
you can just get the app from the
App Store
or
Play Store
and sign up through that.
If you’d like a European or other number then let us know at
founders@devyce.com
and we’ll hook you up.
