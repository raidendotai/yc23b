Hi everyone – we are Brandon & Brayden from Outerbase.
📚 TL;DR
Current database tooling is poorly designed and historically been targeted solely at developers. Outerbase is a modern platform that allows you and your entire team to view the data you need whether it be in Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery or more.
🪨 The Problem
Getting access to your data is hard. Typically there are only a few people who hold the keys to it at any given company and they quickly become a bottleneck on data requests. The tooling around it is outdated and poorly designed, and not intended for the modern collaborative work environments.
⚒️ Our Solution
Outerbase provides an intuitive interface with granular access to your data. It has a familiar spreadsheet-like experience that anyone can use. Outerbase’s EZQL provides a sql-less experience through the use of GPT-3. You can take those same queries and create beautiful dashboards all in one experience.
⚙️ How Outerbase Works
We sit on top of most relational database types, including Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery, and Snowflake. You simply provide your database credentials and Outerbase gives you a spreadsheet-like experience to view, edit, query, and visualize your data. Since access is based on your credentials you can easily control how granularly your team accesses your data. Our EZQL feature is powered by OpenAI and takes your databases schema and structures your questions/queries based on it.
