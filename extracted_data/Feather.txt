Hi!
We’re Ash and Patrick, the co-founders of Feather!
❌ Financial Data is Too Expensive
Successful investing requires rationally analyzing the facts — but where to find these facts quickly, easily, and inexpensively?
Wall Street’s biggest institutions depend on tools like the Bloomberg Terminal to instantly discover compelling investments. But at over $25,000 per year, they exclude most investors from the same opportunities.
📈 Feather Fixes This
Feather provides real-time financial data on every major tradeable asset class, from equities, options, and bonds to commodities, currencies, and macroeconomies.
Feather also provides data on 11,000 institutions (holdings, transactions, etc.) and 10,000 individuals (insider purchases/sales, transaction histories, etc.).
Investors can discover insider trades, check analysts’ growth and earnings expectations, and compare companies’ valuation multiples — all in one place, within seconds.
Feather’s pricing starts at just $39 per month, empowering investors to make informed, wealth-building decisions with data available only to Wall Street until now.

👨‍💻 Why Are We Building This?
We are building Feather to scratch our own itch. Before co-founding Feather, I founded a long-only, value-oriented hedge fund from my freshman dorm room at Vanderbilt and led it to approach $1 million capitalization. While running the fund, I exhausted my access to Vanderbilt’s on-campus Bloomberg Terminal and was forced to find an alternative that did not cost over $25,000 per year. After searching extensively, I discovered no existing platform affordably provided the data I needed, so I partnered with Patrick to build our own solution.
