👋 Hi everyone! We are Shariar, Jordan, and Miguel and we are excited to introduce you to Ruby!
Ruby is a neobank for e-commerce businesses. We offer a robust and flexible expense management solution with the ability to manage spend in the way that works best for each business. We integrate into the platforms that make them money, such as Shopify, Stripe, and Amazon, and aggregate their financial and commerce data to give them a unified view of the financial health of their business, empowering business owners to make smarter decisions. Ruby is live and we have already
processed millions in transactions
💵 since joining YC.
🚨
Problem
Traditional banking services often fail e-commerce businesses because:
Bespoke expense management solutions
aren’t flexible enough
to fit the unique expense patterns of each business
Slow money movement makes businesses
wait 3-5 days
to use their money which creates a bottleneck for the business’ order fulfillment and cash flow
Each commerce platform has become its own pseudo-bank. Cash positions and
money movements are scattered
between different platforms
Tons of manual work
is required to aggregate this data which is prone to errors and makes it difficult to determine simple metrics such as cash flow
💡
Solution
Ruby provides a better banking experience that is catered to the issues faced by e-commerce businesses. We offer:
💳 A flexible spend management system that allows you to categorize your spend as granular as you need to fit your business structure
⚡️ Instant deposits (even on the weekends!) to ensure your cash flow isn’t restricted. Businesses no longer need to wait days for deposits to fulfill orders
⚙️ Integrations into commerce platforms, like Shopify, Stripe, and Amazon, to unify all their data into one place and give them a complete picture of their finances and business operations
📊 Real time analytics on commerce and financial data that makes it seamless for users to answer questions like:
What are my true expenses for each platform I sell on?
What is my cash position and cash flow?
Am I profitable?

The Team
Shariar, Jordan, and Miguel have built e-commerce stores together and it became clear how restrictive traditional banking was for our businesses and how big of a pain it was to get an accurate full picture of our finances. It became impossible to keep track of spend and revenue without wasting hours making manual calculations from all the tools we were using.
With engineering experience from top companies like Google, Capital One, and Salesforce, the team decided to come together to tackle all these issues and create a banking solution that makes tracking the financial health of your e-commerce business a breeze.
