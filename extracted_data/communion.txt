Hey homies!
Excited to share what we‚Äôve been working on at communion.
the problem
We‚Äôre a team of builders who have worked on mobile, web, and api applications before. we had so many issues scaling growth. The content we created felt like we were shouting into the void and the ad spend felt like lighting buckets of money on fire.
the solution
Connect your accounts to see all your ad spend results and organic post performance in one place.
One of our recent campaigns used TikTok‚Äôs suggested audience feature which displayed B2B content to the teenage demographic, quick changes increased our conversion rate 150%.
It‚Äôs 2023 so of course there‚Äôs a generative AI part - create more content based on what‚Äôs working and dump what isn‚Äôt.
One of our customers found a google keyword that was performing particularly well after weeks of testing and then created several pieces of complementary content instantly.
