tl;dr:
We match individuals with
expert ADHD coaches for 1:1 coaching
at a price never offered before.
Hi YC family! 👋 We’re Chris & Vikram, and we’re building
Shimmer
. Our mission is for every individual with ADHD to reach their full potential,
their way
.
❌ The Problem
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects 5% of adults (13M in US), but most are still struggling to get their symptoms in check.
It’s not a lack of knowledge, it’s action
: People with ADHD know to make a list, they just don’t do it. We need practice, experimentation, and accountability.
Good behavioral interventions price most people out:
Quality ADHD coaching costs $300-600+/mo. This prices out, well, the people who need it most.
The process is cumbersome & not fit for ADHD
: I’ve been there (Chris): dozens of consultation calls, not knowing what to ask, dated technology, confusing e-mail chains, scared to pull the trigger, the list goes on.
✨ Our Solution
Shimmer is a platform that connects expert ADHD coaches with members, facilitates weekly calls, and offers accountability and support via our iOS & Android apps. By truncating or “chunking” the sessions, offering asynchronous tools & resources, and streamlining coaches’ back-end tasks, we offer coaching at 5-10X more affordable than alternatives.
⚙️ How it works
Join Shimmer
—Members start with an intake form that helps kick off their personalized journey. This helps the coach choose 1 of our 3 science-backed tracks to go down.
Meet your coach
—Members meet weekly (for 15- or 45-min meetings) over video or audio to review progress, unpack topics, and set goals for the upcoming week.
Weekly actionable plans
—The real work happens between sessions. Members are laser-focused on the few tasks they’ve chosen for the week. The coach & app provides accountability & support throughout.
