TLDR
Palomma
helps online merchants and apps in LatAm save 70-80% on card processing fees and increase conversions, by enabling frictionless Pay by Bank for their customers (consumers and/or businesses).
The problem
Receiving card payments is expensive for merchants, it costs them between 2 to 5% per transaction
Receiving the cheaper alternative, Pay by Bank, poses several frictions:
Low conversion:
multiple steps are required to checkout via existing Pay by Bank solutions, resulting in a ~40% failure rate
Non-recurrent:
different from cards, existing Pay by Bank alternatives are hard to enable for recurring payments, requiring complex direct integrations with local banks
Confirmation:
confirming a bank payment requires checking bank accounts in real-time, or trusting the proof of confirmation sent by the customer (fraud-prone)
Reconciliation:
existing Pay by Bank data is cryptic: i.e., “68068407595”, making reconciliation difficult
The solution:
A single API and platform that allows online merchants or apps across LatAm (starting with Colombia) to receive frictionless Pay by Bank payments
Higher conversion:
30-40% more conversion with frictionless Pay by Bank
Recurrent:
easily enable recurrent Pay by Bank payments
Confirmation:
allow your employees to instantly confirm bank payments via our dashboard and WhatsApp / email notifications
Easy reconciliation:
clearly identify each Pay by Bank payment in our dashboard
PD: we´re also working on frictionless cash-out bank payments through our API & platform ;) 🔜
Why are we building this?
During his time at Nubank,
Cipriano
personally saw the pain experienced by online merchants and apps with high card processing fees, and the friction around the cheaper, Pay by Bank alternatives.
