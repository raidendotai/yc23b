The Problem
Extensive content editing interfaces and real-time collaboration are a key feature of most apps to deliver value to their users, such as Notion, Miro, Figma, and Google Docs.
While the users of these apps expect a best-in-class editing and collaboration experience, it's super painful and complex to develop. As developers, we can testify to this: Entire IT departments despair of these tasks.
