Tl;dr
: Spine AI simplifies the process of integrating AI copilots into your products. Now, complex tasks within products like JIRA, such as custom reporting or bulk updates, can be effortlessly managed. Simply have your users instruct our AI copilot and watch as it seamlessly executes your commands. Interested in the power of AI copilots for your products? We're just a message away!
Hello everyone, we are Akshay and Ashwin ‚Äì the co-founders of Spine AI üëã. We've been friends for over a decade, with our shared journey beginning at the University of Waterloo. Our interest in machine learning took root in an unlikely place ‚Äì a building called
Spine
at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore during an exchange term.
In the past five years, we've collaborated with more than 45 enterprises, guiding them toward the next levels of AI maturity. This year, we've successfully integrated LLM-related technologies into over six companies, leading to a clear projected ROI. This journey has brought some key insights to light:
The gap between creating a text generation prototype with tools like OpenAI and deploying a value-adding product is significant.
Customer expectations are evolving, with
hybrid UI paradigms (command + intent)
becoming increasingly prevalent.
To maximize their benefits, AI copilots must perform actions on users' behalf, saving time and creating new workflow possibilities. This is the core functionality of our Spine-powered copilots.
üí™ The Power of AI Copilots
AI copilots streamline complex UI workflows, morphing them into an intuitive, natural language-based interface.
Adding an AI copilot to B2B products is becoming table-stakes (as seen with
Shopify
,
Microsoft
,
Notion
, etc.) for companies that have the capacity to build them. At Spine AI, we're on a mission to democratize this.
When added to enterprise SaaS products, AI copilots have helped companies increase ARR by $1M. üí∞
AI copilots enhance your product by adding an intelligence layer that directly connects users to backend APIs, documents, and databases, making previously challenging workflows easily implementable.
üí¢ The Problem
Developing reliable AI copilots, which offer a wide range of functionalities, demands a significant investment of time and resources, requiring extensive AI and engineering expertise throughout the entire lifecycle.
Embedding diverse actions into the copilots, such as API calls, documentation updates, multi-modality, and authentication handling, can extend the development timeline beyond six months.
The addition of complex features, like custom reporting and integrations, can further prolong the development cycle, putting additional strain on already-packed roadmaps.
üéØ The Solution
Enter Spine AI ‚Äì the easiest way to build reliable AI copilots for your products. Our platform converts API docs, DB schemas, and multi-modal documents into fully operational AI copilots that integrate effortlessly with just a few lines of code.
During the setup process, each copilot is equipped with a custom orchestrator, trained to effectively transform user intents into concrete actions.
Maintain complete control over the product interface with the ability to customize the permitted actions, enabled workflows, and the copilot's response style to users.
Once integrated, the AI copilot becomes a superuser of your product ‚Äì an indispensable assistant always at your users' disposal, enabling them to harness your product's full potential.
