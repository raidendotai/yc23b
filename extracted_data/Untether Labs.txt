TL;DR
Clinics are facing an existential problem - fix margins to survive. Weâ€™ve built a digital clinic, and seen the tech they need to improve margins. Now weâ€™re bringing this tech back to other clinics. For our first customer, weâ€™re projected to generate $2.5M in revenue.
ðŸ¤¯ PROBLEM Â· MARGIN
Doctors (MDs, nurses, therapists) spend less than 50% of their day seeing patients.
Yet you, as a patient, canâ€™t get an appointment 4+ weeks out. Why? â€¦ archaic software.
Care models for digital clinics have evolved
. Care happens over calls, texts, at-home, in-person and over state lines covering insurance requirements.Â Scheduling the supply of doctors with the fluctuating patient demand is too complex for billion-dollar clinics to be coordinating out of spreadsheets. So while demand for healthcare has grown rapidly,
margins are poor
.
ðŸ’¡ SOLUTION Â· SAAS
We help clinics improve margins through an all-in-one tool that offers better scheduling, reporting, and forecasting.
Scheduling
to optimize doctors and appointments across specialties, regions, and insurance regulations:
Reporting
. One dashboard to track margin, patient demand, and doctor utilization.
Forecasting
to help Clinics prepare for fluctuating demand, and scenarios.
