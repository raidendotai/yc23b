Hey everyone! We’re Mika, Slava, and Dima from
Intently
😃!
This is our second YC company. Our previous venture grew to 250 people and raised over $150M. While scaling Mighty Buildings,
we faced the challenges of the sales process
– for each successful interaction, countless poorly-timed outreach messages and
missed opportunities piled up
📚.
The reason is simple
- your marketing and sales teams simply can't access and analyze the sheer volume of data available today. Fortunately, what’s challenging for humans is easy for AI.
How does Intently work?
Think of us as the
Google of people search 🔍
: tell us who you want to target, and we'll provide a ranked list of prospects based on their likelihood of buying.
Intently leverages AI to analyze a wealth of data - from social media presence to digital footprints, to pinpoint prospects with buying intent signals relevant to your offering. We complete each profile with valuable data to help you understand their specific needs and craft tailored proposals.
As a team that's been on both sides – bombarded with unwanted sales pitches and now promoting our solution to fellow YC community –  we've experienced firsthand how intent data helps us prospect smarter and close deals faster ⚡. And we're eager to help you achieve the same!
Our ask
If you're in the B2B space and want to accelerate your growth with accurate intent data,
