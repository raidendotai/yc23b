💥TL;DR
We’re building DocuSign for document collection where clients can upload documents into a secure, interactive checklist without creating an account.

😩 The Problem:
Businesses need to collect documents from clients, but the process is often disorganized, time-consuming and insecure.
To collect documents securely businesses have to either 1) set up clunky client portals with accounts for each of their clients, or 2) create Dropbox/Box folders for each request and email their clients links to an empty folder with a list of what to upload. Both of these methods are a pain for clients, inefficient for the firm, and a nightmare to keep track of.
Firms also have to send out burdensome follow up emails to remind clients to upload their documents, and sift through poorly named and unorganized files to make sense of what their clients sent them.
🥳 Our Solution
Pigeon
is a web platform where you can send itemized request checklists to your clients’ emails so they know exactly which documents you need, clients can securely upload documents into the checklist without needing an account, and you can track and manage all of your requests in an organized dashboard. Pigeon will also send automatic reminder emails to your clients to make sure they submit their documents on time.
