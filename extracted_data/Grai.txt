TL;DR Grai makes developers smarter by bringing metadata from across their stack into their development tools. We make testing data flows between applications painless.

Problem
Tracking (let alone testing) data once it leaves a production environment is challenging. Whether in a data engineers transformation pipeline, an ML model, or the CFOâ€™s metrics dashboard, that data
will
be used elsewhere. Without visibility on those use cases data changes remain risky and outage prone.

Solution
Grai is an open-source data management platform designed to help you better use your data.
Automated data lineage
- Pre-built connectors to keep metadata fresh.
Integrated with git
