TL;DR:
Docsum
is an AI contract reviewer for sales teams. With Docsum, sales teams don't have to wait for their lawyer to respond to redlines on a contract, they can do it themselves.
Start reviewing your contracts now.
Problem
Sales teams often own the contracting process from reviewing NDAs to sending out MSAs.
Sales teams are motivated to respond to clients quickly and reduce their time to close
but their ability to review and respond to contract redlines is contingent on collaboration with their legal counsel.
This process can be expensive, time consuming, and hard to manage.
For smaller teams, basic contract review and contract negotiation services with external counsel can be incredibly expensive and time consuming.
For larger organizations, in-house counsels are burdened by high matter volumes that often position them as bottlenecks within sales cycles.
