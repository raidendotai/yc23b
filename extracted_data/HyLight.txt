Hello everyone, we are
HyLight
. We build small unmanned hydrogen airships to automatically gather massive amounts of precise data in a sustainable and cost-effective way.
🚫
The problem :
We currently focus on:
💨 Pipeline inspection to detect methane leaks (4% of global greenhouse gas emissions).
⚡Power line inspection to prevent outages, reduce wildfire risks ($19 billion per year in the US), and ensure grid reliability.
Current solutions (helicopters, airplanes, satellites and drones) are not adapted to make accurate, efficient and sustainable observations.
✅
Our solution
:
Our solution is a crossover between drone and lighter than air technologies, using hydrogen as a lifting gas and power source.
This vehicle combines long range, high payload, and hovering capabilities
We have already built four prototypes,
two minimum viable products (MVPs)
, and are running a paid pilot with the largest power line company in Europe.
🙏
