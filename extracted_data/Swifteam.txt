Hello, everyone! This is
Angelo
here to introduce
Swifteam
!
A bit of background about us and our recent pivot: We started in EdTech in YCS20 but soon realized the founding team‚Äôs strength is in the SaaS market. We‚Äôre now building Swifteam to solve our growing pain over the years.
‚ùå
The Problem
Why we built Swifteam?
We started Swifteam because we used to manage up to 200 contractors around the globe and wanted to build better device management and inventory solution for remote teams like us.
‚ú®
Our Solution
Swifteam helps distributed teams manage their devices, purchase new ones, and¬†retrieve them when employees leave the company.
Why do we need a new solution for device management?
You might work in California but have team members distributed in Texas, New York, Paris, and Singapore. Things like these might occur to you:
Sending, retrieving, and storing devices for remote teams is painful.
Losing data for security risks could keep you up at night.
Employee data is across multiple platforms, eg. Gusto and Deel, and have no audit trails of who owns which devices.
