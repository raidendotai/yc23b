refine
is an
open-source
,
headless
React framework for developers building enterprise web applications. It eliminates many repetitive tasks such as
➡️ CRUD operations ➡️ State management ➡️ Routing ➡️ Authentication ➡️ Access Control & ➡️ i18n
and saves days of development time.
As a developer-focused alternative to existing
low-code/no-code
enterprise tools,
refine
allows developers to
work with the stack they are already familiar
with
and have
100% control over their projects.

Solution
Thanks to its unique “
Headless UI
” approach, refine works with any custom design. It has ready-made integrations with the 4 most popular UI frameworks:
Ant Design
,
Material UI
,
Chakra UI
and
Mantine
. refine is totally backend agnostic and can connect to
15+ backend services
out-of-the-box, incl.
custom REST & GraphQL API’s.
You can give it a try on
refine.new
to see how easily you can create tailor-made projects in seconds, by combining your preferred tools and technologies.
The Framework
Instead of being a limited set of pre-styled components,
refine core
is a lean collection of
helper hooks
,
components
, and
providers
. They are all decoupled from UI components and business logic, so that they
never keep you from customizing your UI or coding your own flow.
Community
refine
is backed by a robust community that showcases the following metrics:
⭐️ 12K GitHub stars
👩‍💻 150+ Contributors
💻 5,000+ Commits
💬 2,500 Discord members
Use Cases
So far,
thousands
of great projects have been built by
15,000+ monthly active refine developers
. Use cases include but are not limited to
Admin Panels
Forms
Dashboards
Storefronts
Internal tools
B2B Solutions
SaaS Interfaces
What’s Next?
In addition to our endless contributions to the open-core framework, we are also developing cloud-based products to make refine a comprehensive platform for developers to build enterprise-grade web applications.
