tl;dr:
We connect healthcare professionals with certified coaches and peers with shared lived experiences without month-long wait times or the risk of losing their license. For healthcare employers, we provides data on staff mental health trends and provides tailored recommendations on how to support staff wellness.
Hi everyone, we are Sanketh, Veeraj, and Nikhil and we’re the team behind
Vitalize Care
. We’re on a mission to improve the mental heath of healthcare professionals through a new virtual care model centered around their lived experiences.

👨🏽‍🎨
Sanketh (CPO)
paints the product vision: Sanketh has published in healthcare 20+ times, including the largest study on healthcare worker PTSD during COVID, led product strategy for a seed-stage health-tech startup, and spent over 1000 hours working in hospitals, where he witnessed the problem firsthand.
👨🏽‍✈️
Veeraj (CEO)
navigates the go-to-market strategy: Veeraj grew up with a chronic disease, and many of his clinicians have left the profession due to burnout. Veeraj was an MD/PhD student who previously founded two healthcare nonprofits, worked on digital health strategy at Rock Health, and co-led clinician mental health initiatives with US Surgeon General.
👨🏽‍💻
Nikhil (CTO)
builds the platform: Nikhil was one of the first 3 engineers at Vincere Health, a digital health startup backed by United Healthcare, and built AI/ML models for Eli Lilly. He recently left Columbia’s MS of Data Science program to work on Vitalize Care.
🚨
The Problem:
Burnout rates in healthcare are at all-time highs
We’ve all seen recent headlines of nursing strikes, clinicians committing suicide or leaving the profession, and more. Over 60% of healthcare professionals are suffering from moral injury and burnout. This is costing our healthcare system
billions
of dollars, and sacrificing our ability to deliver high quality patient care.
Current solutions are broken and experience < 5% engagement because of:
Month-long wait times
+ a limit on the number of sessions
Therapists that
do not understand
the realities of working in healthcare
Content doesn’t cater to
healthcare-specific stressors
Lack of peer support
and healthcare-focused communities
💜
Our Solution:
A new model of care centered around the challenges of working in healthcare
From years of academic research, we are pioneering a new model of care. Every step of the way, we co-designed our platform with healthcare professionals.
Our mobile app allows healthcare professionals to connect with certified coaches and peers who have been in their shoes before through 1-on-1 and group sessions. We allow complete control over anonymity by offering real-time voice changing for group sessions. We complement this with text-based peer support and a library of mindfulness resources.
For healthcare employers, we offer a dashboard with aggregated data on staff mental health trends and drivers of burnout on a departmental level. We provide tailored recommendations to leadership on how to support staff wellness.
From published data of small-scale coaching interventions, we estimate that our model can generate upwards of
$4.2M in cost-savings
for the average hospital.
