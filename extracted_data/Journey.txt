What we help with
Send a Journey when you want to win a deal:
Thousands of founders fundraise
via Journey
Hundreds of B2B sales deals are won
via Journey
Journeys are fun to receive because they’re beautiful and contain all the information and next steps a person needs
. You can include slides, PDFs, videos, Looms, calendar embeds — just about anything.
🐣 Stop sending a bunch of erratic links and start sending a beautiful personalized Journey.
What is it, specifically
Journeys are webpages that have the structure of slides:
On the left you have the steps of your pitch, and then each step can be all sorts of content: Slides, Videos, Onboarding Checklists, Calendars, or
anything else
.
Okay. I made a Journey. Now what?
Journeys have rich insights about who is opening and viewing your content.
It’s like having Google Analytics for your pitch
.
