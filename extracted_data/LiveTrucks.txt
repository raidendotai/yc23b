TLDR:
LiveTrucks
is a real-time visibility and alerting platform for Freight. If you are shipper like WholeFoods, you can see all your truck shipments on the map and get alerts for missed ETAs, spoiled cargo and much more.
Hey folks, we are
Rahul
and
Tanuj
, and we are excited to launch LiveTrucks.
Problem:
Trucks move 72% of the freight in the US, and yet freight shippers and brokers have no easy way of locating their truck shipments.
Chaos from the lack of visibility into truckloads creates billions of dollars in losses from missed ETAs, severe backlogs, spoiled cargo, detention penalties and hours of back office work per truck load.
Traditionally, shippers and brokers have located the 3.5 million OTR trucks in the US mainly through ‚Äúcheck calls‚Äù (manually calling a truck driver every 2 hours to ask for current location and ETA)
One of our users doing check calls and recording locations manually pre-LiveTrucks:
My cofounder Tanuj first saw this problem internally at UberFreight (Uber‚Äôs freight brokerage) where hours were wasted per load in simply locating the truck. We set out to dig deeper and realized this problem affects
100,000 shippers
and
17,000 brokerages
in the US.
Solution:
Instantly
see truck shipments on the map and
get alerts
when something goes wrong.
LiveTrucks is bringing rideshare-like visibility to Freight. Under the hood, we use a quilt of 70+ datasources (from flip phones to smartphones and telematics) along with easy permissioning to reach every commercial truck in the US.
