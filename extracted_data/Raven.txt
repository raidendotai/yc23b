TL;DR
Raven gives businesses a central platform to manage product notifications across SMS, Email, Push, WhatsApp, Slack & more. We do this by connecting 40+ providers like Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase with a single API and giving a central dashboard on top to design & monitor all notifications.

Hey everyone - We’re Priyansh and Sriyansh (yes, we are brothers!) and we would love to tell you about
Raven
.
🚫THE PROBLEM
Businesses spend a lot of resources managing product notifications (think due-date reminders or verification codes). For example to send a payment reminder via SMS, Email & WhatsApp, you have to integrate multiple provider APIs like Twilio, SendGrid, then orchestrate channels basis user preferences and finally send the correct template on-time. The problem is -
Since each notification has it’s own set of templates & configurations, it becomes complex & time consuming to make any changes.
There’s no central visibility as the data is spread across multiple messaging providers. It is a pain for product teams to pull it from 5-6 diff sources, standardize and then analyze them.
Ensuring deliverability is a challenge. Some messages like OTPs are critical and their delivery failures lead to huge business losses.
🎁OUR SOLUTION
A central platform that brings all your messaging channels & providers in one place, where you can orchestrate and analyze them - all without engineering.
A single API to send notifications across channels via any of the 40+ providers like Twilio, SES, Firebase, Messagebird, Gupshup.
A dashboard gives central visibility on all templates, logs & delivery metrics allowing product teams to optimize CX by analyzing what works and what doesn’t, reduce redundant messages and thereby saving tons of money.
Reduces business risk by effectively managing delivery failures using failovers/retries across channels & providers.
💡WHY WE BUILT THIS
We’ve previously built the notification infrastructure for Apna (India’s fastest unicorn) & OkCredit (YC S18), and didn’t want any other engineer to go through the same pain as we did. It was not only us, but companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, AirBnB spend $10s of millions/yr with a 10-30 member engineering & product team which just does notifications 🤯.
