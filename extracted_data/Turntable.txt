TL,DR:
Turntable is a collaborative tool to create and manage data pipelines- built from the ground up with AI. To start, we’re focused on reducing the time and cost of transforming data within DBT, an open-source data engineering platform. Check out our first drop,
DBT copilot
.
🐌 Problem
Despite being one of the most important parts of a modern business, data transformation tools are often hard to use, slow, and uninspiring. Data teams spend the majority of their time finding the right data, creating pipelines, and responding to ad-hoc requests. With the added issue that recruiting data talent is difficult, data pipelines quickly become a bottleneck for product development and business learning.
⏩ Solution
Our first product is a
DBT copilot
that allows DBT users to do in minutes what they previously could do in hours or days. Our copilot currently supports:
generating or modifying DBT code
writing DBT schema and documentation
generating code for sharing DBT models in BI or visualization tools

In the future, you’ll see us launch more features and integrations to make it easier to find and contextualize data within your analytics codebase and collaborate with your teammates.
📚 Backstory
We’ve all either worked on data teams or have been customers of data teams that have been blocked on data pipeline work:
Justin led commercial data science at Cruise where he managed a team of data scientists that spent 70% of their time managing data pipelines in DBT.
Ian was the tech lead for growth & data engineering teams at Pinterest and Stripe, where he had to build internal tools and hacks to get around data pipeline constraints.
Wally led product for Twitter’s Home Timeline team, which would often be blocked on the creation of new metrics and data pipelines- slowing down product development and learning.
Together, we started Turntable because we believe that generative AI has created an opening to build a new standard for data transformation tools.

If your company doesn’t use DBT, we’d love introductions to data teams at companies that do
