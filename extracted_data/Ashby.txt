👋Hey everyone - I’m Benji, Co-Founder and CEO of Ashby.
Ashby is a new take on recruiting software - optimized for ambitious, operationally minded hiring teams. You can think of it as a bundle of an ATS, a sourcing tool, a scheduling automation product and a recruiting specific BI tool.
📝 Our story
Ashby was founded by my Co-Founder Abhik and I after we struggled hiring large Engineering teams with existing ATS products. Recruiting has become a lot more sophisticated over the last few years - because competition for talent has become fiercer - and we simply felt that products had not kept up with that.
💡 Bringing data and power to talent teams
A few years ago “recruiting operations” was still a foreign concept to most companies, but that is changing quickly as companies of all stages are getting more sophisticated about how they recruit.
Our goal is to provide these ambitious hiring teams with a bundle of best in class tools:
📊 We’ve focused on powerful reporting and dashboarding from day one. Modern recruiting teams run on data and we provide them with all the reporting tools they need, directly within Ashby
⚙️ We provide a scalable ATS that has all of the features you’d expect (from posting jobs over approvals to custom fields and permission roles) but that is also easy to use for the end-user (and for early stage teams)
📆 Scheduling automation allows your team to schedule interviews 3x faster while also providing candidates with a significantly better experience
💌 To help you build pipeline we include a Chrome Extension, email discovery and multi-touch email sequences (including, sending on behalf of other team members)
