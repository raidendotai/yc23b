👋🏻 Hey Alex & Jess here from W23 batch!
✨ TLDR ✨
We’re building an
API for launching credit products
. We enable any company to offer credit by handling origination, underwriting, compliance and servicing with just a few lines of code. Using Pier, our customers can offer credit to their borrowers/users without ever directing them outside their app, while Pier’s API powers it all under the hood.
⛔️ The Problem ⛔️
Launching a credit product in the US is extremely complex, expensive and time consuming — Companies have to build a lending function from scratch, pay millions of dollars for a bank charter, and spend months or years to implement. These combined factors often break the unit economics of a fast-growing company and are usually not part of a company’s core competency.
✅ Our Solution ✅
Pier enables companies to go live with their own credit product in weeks, not months!
🔥
Speed is our (and your) currency
- our platform and implementation process is designed to take you live in weeks, not months
