TL;DR:
Muffin Data
is an analytics platform built specifically for your favorite food and beverage brands sold in retail stores.
😔 The problem
If you’re selling products in retail (imagine any packaged product the next time you’re walking down the aisle at Whole Foods), there are huge barriers for you to take action on your data. These barriers are incredibly painful, costing
time, money, and manual effort
:
Disparate data:
all your data lives in separate portals and is hard to combine in a meaningful way
No automation:
almost
no data
in our space is exposed via programmatic API
No standardization:
because everyone is pulling manually, everyone problem-solves in their own bespoke way
📊
The solution
To solve this, we connect to your brand’s major data sources —
retailer portals
(daily sales for each store and product a brand sells) and
distribution portals
(shipments to stores and inventory) — to extract, normalize, and enrich the data for common analytics use cases.
Our first product gives the end-user an easy plug-and-play dashboard to understand
velocity and distribution
at at the
retailer, store, and product
level. Under the hood, it’s the first unified data warehouse built specifically for food and beverage.
🌱 Our backstory
We (
Andrés Recalde
and
Sal Calvo
) met building data warehouses at a startup called RJMetrics. Andrés went on to build data teams in the CPG industry at fast-growing brands like La Colombe, Gopuff, and Banza — and realized along the way how limited the existing data tooling for the industry really is.
Here we are at Expo West 2023 peddling our wares for the first time! 🤘
🙏 Our ask —
If you
know any
food and beverage brands
who would be interested in trying us out, we’d love an intro (
founders@muffindata.com
) and a chance to demo. We’re excited to add to our already-activated list of early customers.
