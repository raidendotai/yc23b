TLDR:
Monitaur
is the easiest way to monitor your decentralized applications at scale. Consider us the Datadog for Web3 apps. We pretty much keep your Web3 application stacks from exploding!

The
Problem
Building, maintaining, and running decentralized applications at scale is still a black box for most companies and institutions.
Current observability and monitoring tooling is built with sole developers in mind and does not account for x-team or x-organizational functionality, I.E., support, product, DevOps.
The lack of transparency within Web3 applications, including traditional Web2 components, leaves blind spots that can turn into potential problems and unwarranted downtime.
Most Web3 observability tooling has a steep learning curve and is built with subject matter experts in mind.
A lack of change management tooling for decentralized applications, resulting in poor operational rigor and efficiency.
Most monitoring for Web3 applications does not consider behavioral changes or anomalies, which frequently results in only capturing what went wrong after the fact.
Current monitoring services and other stand-alone observability tooling are insufficient because they are not designed for scaling startups, enterprises, and managed services providers seeking to adopt decentralized applications into their architectures. These companies resort to building in-house tooling or adopting several tools across the observability stack, increasing operational complexity and overhead.
