EzDubs is an AI video dubbing tool that translates videos and livestreams while preserving the voice of the original speaker.

Mission
Breaking down
language barriers
to videos
across the internet
Language inaccessibility sucks
Enterprises
and
creators
can’t broadcast their videos and livestreams to different geographies, and
lose out on brand growth
and
revenue
Consumers
can’t discover foreign language content and recommendation engines keep them
isolated within their geography
Current dubbing solutions are:
Expensive
- inaccessible to smaller creators / enterprises
Human dependent
- having humans translate and voice every video leads to turn around times of days/weeks and isn't scalable
Unable to service livestreams
- live interpreter services are expensive, require humans to join each call, and lose the original speaker’s identity
The EzDubs Solution - Fully automated, real-time AI dubbing
Instant turnarounds
- dub livestreams in real-time and simultaneously engage with multiple audiences across the globe
Scale
+
affordability
- automatically dub all videos uploaded to a platform using our API and eliminate hiring human interpreters / voice actors for each different language
Voice preservation
- preserving the voice of the original speaker in the translated language makes for a more authentic viewing experience (esp. for livestreams), and enables creators to grow their brand internationally
