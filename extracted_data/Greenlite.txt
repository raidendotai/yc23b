Problem
Fintech compliance teams
spend millions of dollars on manual anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) reviews
. To support customer growth, fintechs turn to outsourced analysts or consultants to complete these reviews.Â  The workflows assigned to outsourced teams are routine, clearly-defined and require risk-based decisions to be escalated to a full-time employee (FTE).
Managing outsourced analysts is painful and expensive.
Training takes months, quality assurance is a challenge and any additional tooling/automation needs to be built by your internal engineering teams.
Critically, the productivity of these AML teams are low
.
McKinsey estimated
that as little as 15% of an AML investigatorâ€™s time is spent actually investigating. Manual processes, administrative tasks and limited working hours leave backlogs to grow, increasing risks of a major fine.
Solution
Greenlite
â€™s AI agents learn your alert review process and work 24/7 to complete entry-level KYC and AML tasks.
They pair language models and 200+ data sources to action false positives, investigate high-risk customers and create audit-ready narratives.
Suspicious activity is escalated to your FTEs, allowing you to be in control of risk based decisions.
Hereâ€™s how it works
Choose where you need staff augmentation
Greenlite supports three agent archetypes (with more to come). Each one can learn your companyâ€™s specific workflows to handle routine cases.
Add your policy, data sources and fuzziness thresholds
Upload your workflow policy, define the data sources that are needed for this job and determine the fuzziness threshold youâ€™re comfortable with.
Review escalated cases
Agents will escalate cases that require a risk based decision. Importantly, your FTEsÂ get an enriched case, complete with entity investigation details, data analysis and open-source intelligence to make high quality decisions more efficiently.
