Hi üëã
We‚Äôre Jordan and Carlos and we‚Äôre excited to share our new product called
Waypoint
. Waypoint makes it easy for software teams to design, orchestrate, monitor product-triggered emails. Think of it as an email delivery service that is geared for data-rich transactional emails (like order confirmations, reminders, receipts, alerts, and other system notifications).
The problem
Adding data-rich email notifications to software in 2023 is still a pain. Most email tools are repurposed marketing email builders for templates with little to no dynamic data. This means getting data into branded templates and setting up logic around them (eg. delays) still requires significant code within your code base. Additionally, existing tools are lacking from an observability standpoint which makes it difficult for developers to test and debug.
While it‚Äôs easy to hate on emails, the truth is that emails still act as the ‚Äò
glue of UX
‚Äô for most platforms and it is often the key to onboarding and engaging users.
