What clients say
: ‚ÄúWe were blown away by the engagement rates!‚Äù
Problem and why existing solutions don‚Äôt work
Companies need to engage their employees on compliance-related topics, but employees hate e-learning. We‚Äôve all had to click through some sort of long, deeply uninspiring course, right?
But why does employee engagement matter?
Well, beyond the moral case for a more equitable and harassment free world - negative workplace behaviors lead to lawsuits, lower productivity, and higher employee churn.
