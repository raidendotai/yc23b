Tl;dr
: Dittofeed is a developer-focused, open-source alternative to platforms like Iterable and
Customer.io
. Dittofeed’s streamlined developer experience allows growth engineers to send better-performing marketing messages. Additionally, self-hosting Dittofeed delivers large cost savings to power users who are constrained by existing providers’ volume-based pricing.

Hi everyone, we’re Max and Chandler, and we're equipping the next generation of technical growth teams with the tools they need to ensure their marketing messages look great and get delivered correctly.
The Problem
: Customer engagement platforms are expensive and error-prone.
If you’ve ever received marketing emails with broken links, or opted out of a company’s texts, only to receive an “exclusive offer” text the next day, there’s a reason. And it’s not (for the most part) because growth teams are bad at their job.
Current customer engagement platforms give growth teams the low-code tools they need to automate marketing messages at scale, but none of the technical tools they need to make sure they’re sending the right messages, to the right customers, at the right time. This results in reduced customer conversion and retention rates, as well as frustrated growth engineers.
The Solution
: An open-source customer engagement platform that empowers growth engineers.
Growth teams are becoming increasingly technical, and with that, comes a huge potential for fixing buggy marketing messages. We’re building a future where growth engineers can finally version control email templates and test messaging automations in CI, and where, simultaneously, non-technical growth team members still have access to the low-code tools they’re comfortable with.
Using Dittofeed, you get industry-standard features like a drag-and-drop customer journey builder, a segmentation interface, and a web-based template editor, helpful for non-technical marketers. You ALSO get technical features like:
git-based workflows

a first-in-class testing SDK
