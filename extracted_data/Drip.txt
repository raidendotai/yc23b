Hi everyone! We are
Paulo
,
Bianca
, and
Patrick
and we created Drip after working at Nubank because we believe a solution built on
Pix
(Brazil's new instant payment scheme) can solve several of the problems with a credit card.
ðŸ¥µThe problem with payments in Brazil
Brazil is pretty unique: 30% ($160B) of retail payments are already made in installments but the existing solutions are still uninspiring and 70% of the population want an alternative.
Exorbitant credit card APRs of 400%+
Undifferentiated credit card rewards of 0-1%
No prevailing easy payment button (e.g. Paypal, Apple Pay)
Merchants do not get it better since they pay up to 10-20% to receive funds from a sale.
ðŸ¤©Our solution
Drip combines the best of Pix and a credit card. We enable customers to pay with credit and earn 2%+ cashback with the low cost, speed, and widespread acceptance of Pix (80%+ of Brazilian e-commerce stores).
