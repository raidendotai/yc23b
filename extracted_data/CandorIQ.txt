TLDR;
CandorIQ helps manage headcount spend & employee compensation (including providing benchmarking data). We connect to your HR / Finance stack and provide insights, automate workflows, and allow collaboration across Finance, HR, and Management in 1 single platform.
We provide white-glove onboarding, and go live within a week.
We’re offering 50% off for 1 year for (1) software, (2) comp data & (3) FP&A/Comp Advisory.
❌ The Problem
People are the most important asset for companies and are
70-80% of the spend
. Employee turnover is
24% in 2023.
It is hard to optimize people spend balancing both, because:
Various data required from budget info to compensation benchmarking. Fragmented across spreadsheets, payroll, Captabl, slack & FP&A tools
All decisions require collaboration across multiple personas and departments including HR, Finance, Managers and Execs
Lot’s if repetitive, error prone, manual work. Companies on average spend
10 hours every month updating spend
,
1 month twice a year running merit cycles
,
4 hours generating every candidate offer

Backstory
As former leaders at companies like Checkr (YC S’14) and serial founders, we faced the challenge of understanding budget, pay of our existing teams so that we could optimally hire, reward, retain people. Every decision required spreadsheets, slack, email and a lot of back and forth with HR, Finance and management. This is a problem that plagued us across our experiences from Seed round to IPO. We wanted to flip the script and build a solution that is proactive, continuously updating and automated most of the work for us and other stakeholders.
