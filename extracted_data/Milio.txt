TL;DR:
Milio is building
B2B payments infrastructure for emerging markets, domestic and cross-border
, and connecting it to legacy ERPs through one single API. Milio's platform allows faster money movements, real-time access to data, and treasury automations through efficient workflows and seamless account-to-account domestic and cross-border payments. Real-time and 80% cheaper.
The problem
In Latin America,
legacy B2B payments infrastructure
doesn’t allow automated transaction initiation and costs up to 3% through local ACH networks and credit card processing fees. Cross-border payments rails are expensive and inefficient, with up to 5% FX spreads.
In addition,
no single checkout is built for the B2B-commerce
; and legacy
ERPs are siloed from the payments infrastructure
, involving long treasury workflows and over 20h/week in manual work.
Milio’s solution 💡
Milio enables real-time
B2B account-to-account payments, both domestic and cross-border
, that are
real-time
and save up to 80% of transactions cost and FX rates. Our API provides an
embedded checkout for B2B-commerce
and connects it to legacy ERPs, enabling automated treasury workflows that save our customers over 10h per week in manual work.
Our customers can now access affordable money movements, real-time data, and a
unique B2B checkout experience
that increases conversion rate by 2x.
How does Milio work? ✅
Milio is building an account-to-account payments infrastructure across all of Latin America, both domestic and cross-border, that enables real-time payments (T+0) and the best B2B checkout experience. Our customers can automate how they pay, get paid, and reconcile their ledger, saving up to 80% in transaction costs and over 10h per week in manual work.
They can also offer the best checkout experience to their business customers by enabling account-to-account one-click real-time payments at checkout, designed explicitly for B2B transactions, increasing conversion rates by 2x.
Why are we working on this?
Exchanging money and accessing premium financial services for local enterprises in LatAm is a nightmare. This is experienced every day by business owners across the region, including the co-founders who have spent time working for large payment fintechs and owning SMBs across the region. We firmly believe that helping those local enterprises and entrepreneurs ­means helping any economy to thrive and grow to its maximum potential. We are committed to solving this problem.
