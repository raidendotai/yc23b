TL;DR
Miracle helps biotech and pharma companies accelerate clinical trials by connecting all patient recruitment data sources. Each day of a clinical trial that Miracle’s software can help shave off is worth on average $2M in additional patent-covered revenue opportunity.
Hi everyone! My name is Jin, and I’m the Founder & CEO of Miracle. When I was competing for medals as a former athlete on the USA Archery Team, I used to aim my bow and arrow down at a target 70 meters away. Today, I have my eyes set on improving healthcare by bringing science to life and into hands of patients more quickly.
The Problem
Biotech and pharmaceutical companies (“sponsors”) must run clinical trials (phase 1-3) in order to get FDA approval to market their drug. The
average cost to bring a new drug to market is >$2B
, and clinical trials can take up
7-10 years
of a 20-year patent window. Over
80% of clinical trials are delayed
from patient recruitment, but vendors and clinics do not play along nor provide the transparency necessary for sponsors to account for ROI and, ultimately, runway.
Today, Clinical Operations teams within biotech companies spend
15% of their time manually compiling information
from multiple vendor portals and creating visualizations to report up to management and the board on the study progress – all of which take valuable time that they could be using to focus on improving the study operations.
However, the bigger problem is that without transparent consolidated reporting,
they have no choice but to throw money at vendors and research sites
in hopes of recruiting patients quickly. They have a hard time optimizing the millions of dollars spent each year in a way that would actually expedite their trial.
The Solution
Miracle is a
one-stop shop
for biotech/pharma to fully automate and consolidate their clinical trial reporting needs. We integrate with their vendors and research sites to
eliminate time wasted
on aggregating metrics and compiling reports,
free up their time
to focus on patient recruitment, and make it possible to
optimize ROI on vendors and sites
that are meaningfully speeding up the trial.
