TL;DR
What:
Bluebirds helps outbound teams resell to past customers who have switched jobs. Past customers are
4x more likely to convert to Closed / Won deals
with
much faster sales cycles.
It’s low hanging fruit and flies under the radar because of stale CRM data and workflow limitations.
How:
Any sales rep, manager, or rev ops can sign up on
www.bluebirds.ai
and Bluebirds will automatically identify champions using Machine Learning, detect job changes, and deliver hundreds of warm leads ranked by your ICP.
Traction:
Revenue teams at scale-ups like Front, OneSignal, and a dozen more use Bluebirds to track their customer job changes and maximize outbound efficiency.
Ask: Sign up, or refer any sales teams, and we’ll deliver 100 free warm leads.
Problem and why existing solutions don’t work
Outbound sales isn’t working like it used to.
Conversions rates have tanked
because every sales team is using the same tech stack to spam buyer inboxes, and sales leaders are under pressure from their CEOs and Boards to grow efficiently. But most of the
outbound sales process is not efficient at all.
Luckily there’s one sales play that works exceptionally well – reselling to your past customers who already trust your company and switched jobs. These leads, AKA
“blue birds”
, are your sales teams’ favorite. They’re layups, but also painfully difficult to track at scale.
Existing solutions like LinkedIn Sales Navigator aren’t deeply connected to your CRM
. They don’t know who your customers are or what your ICP is, and rely on
manual / brittle filters
that break
once you have over ~100 customers. The result is that most of your reps just aren’t tracking customer job changes.
Yet 10% to 20% of your CRM contacts have already switched jobs, and 1 to 2% switch every month.
This 👏 Is 👏 ARR 👏 Left 👏 On 👏 The 👏 Table 👏
How Bluebirds works
What used to take reps hours to hack in Sales Navigator now happens automatically with 2 clicks and runs continuously in the background. Oh, and it’s free to get started. Here’s how:
Sign Up:
Anyone (Founders, VPs, Managers, AEs, SDRs, Sales Ops, etc.) can
sign up on our website
and log in via SFDC secure authentication.
Find Champions:
Our algorithms will find which contacts in your CRM are likely to buy your product again.
Match Identities:
We’ll match your sparse contacts to public identities (i.e. john@hotmail is John Smith at Airtable) and check if they’ve switched jobs.
Deliver Leads:
Finally we’ll rank all the leads based on similarity to your ICP and send them to you, along with monthly updates with any fresh job changes.
