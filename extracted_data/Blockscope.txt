What is Blockscope?
Blockscope is a data platform with easy to use tools for the most common use cases in web3 like monitoring for on-chain events, crypto forensics, data indexing, investigations, building dapps & more! Blockscope is used by crypto users, trading firms, web3 startups and institutions.
❌ Problem:
Web3 has a usability problem, currently any interaction is complex and fragmented. For simple things like getting alerted when money moves to your wallet or understanding what happened in a transaction, it’s like you need a degree in cryptography. As developers, traders, and researchers who faced these issues, we realized that without better tools, web3 adoption will not take off. This is precisely the problem we’re solving.
✅ Solution:
At Blockscope we’ve built a suite of tools that work together to help you understand on-chain data in useful ways and take action. All of our tools help do one of the following:
Save engineering hours for developers
Make on-chain data readable and understandable
Enable traders to take informed actions
Help monitor & fight against scams, fraud and hacks
Empower new comers and non-technical individuals
