tl;dr
Vendah helps women in LATAM make extra money by reselling kitchen and homeware to neighbors and friends. A reseller can take orders and collect payments with our mobile app - we then ship bulked products at once to a single reseller, and she'll take care of the last mile delivery, making the economics super attractive. We've already got
15,000 women
selling on our platform growing revenue consistently at a
25% monthly
pace with double-digit
positive gross margin
.
