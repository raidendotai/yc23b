tl;dr:
Serra
takes a 200-line SQL script and reduces it to a few lines of code. Serra simplifies complex pipeline logic with reusable testable objects, saving hours of development and maintenance time.
Hi everyone! We’re Alan and Albert, the best friends behind Serra. We want to simplify ETL so that even your dad (👨🏻) can maintain a data pipeline.
❌ The Problem
Companies spend
$520K
annually building and maintaining data pipelines.
Data engineers spend
44% of their time
fixing pipelines that inevitably crash.

So why do data pipelines crash and burn?
Complex scripts
Limited alerting, debugging
Inadequate testing
All of these make data pipelines a nightmare to fix, especially at 3am.
✨ Our Solution
Serra is a python-based DBT alternative that takes a 200-line SQL script and reduces it to just a few lines of code.
Serra’s framework emphasizes software engineering best practices like
readability, testability, modularity, and reusability
.
Serra
simplifies
complex SQL scripts to just a few lines of Python code with modular transformers and in-house connectors.
Serra provides
fully-customizable error logging
for every transformer and connector.
With a command line tool, developers can easily create pipelines, auto document them,
run local tests
, and
run jobs with their favorite data warehouse.
🤔 How are we different from DBT?
Serra is not tied to SQL and therefore handles all parts of ETL. Serra provides intuitive control flow, more complex transforms with Python, full streaming support, and comprehensive debugging/testing capabilities.
