Double can automate it for you.
What can you do with Double
Given a list of chiropractor websites, find how many chiropractors work there. Don’t count admin staff
Given a list of business names, find their websites, addresses, and phone numbers
Given a list of Etsy stores, find the main category of the products they sell
Given a list of websites of recently funded startups, is this a business that does outbound B2B sales? (that would be interested in our b2b sales prospecting product?)
Roadmap
Our bots are essentially read-only on the web today, but we’re working on abilities to navigate the web and click buttons to do things like login and submit forms (helpful for things that don’t have an API!)
Parsing PDFs as an input
Calling REST APIs. On top of Google Search, Web Scraping, and GPT, we’ll be adding a plugin to make REST API calls, which will unlock every API and the ability to chain arbitrary code execution by calling your code on
repl.it
