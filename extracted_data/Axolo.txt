On top of GitHub Axolo is now also available on GitLab. Now every team who is on Slack and GitLab or GitHub can collaborate seamlessly on code reviews.
ü§Ø Problem:
Why pay engineers 100 thousand dollars to have them sit and wait for their code to be reviewed? Code review workflow is, more often than not, unproductive.
We‚Äôve identified three major problems:
Time to review: Takes too long to be reviewed and it‚Äôs painful.
Context switching: Switching between code review tools and Slack to communicate is a time waster.
Documentation: It‚Äôs hard to document everything that is being said. Merge requests are being talked about in DM and private calls. There is no documentation, and it‚Äôs hard to know why a decision was made.
üéØDevelopers lose precious focus time
We estimate that developers waste at least 2 hours per week coordinating with one another on pull requests.
For a team of 20 that represents the work of 1 developer full-time. This is at least 140k$ per year.
üèö In-house solutions and bots are going OBSOLETE.
Noizy - Alerts everyone and then gets ignored
Hard to maintain
Miss critical info: deployments, GitHub Actions, and checks.
üêô Introducing Axolo: we bring back focus to your developers:
Companies using Axolo have seen a 40% decrease in average cycle time. 86% of developers who use Axolo on a daily basis say that it has improved their code review workflow.
How does it work?
It‚Äôs simple: Axolo creates an ephemeral Slack channel for each code review, invites only the right people, and adds all contextual information needed (CI/CD, ticket link, code conflicts, code review comments, etc..). When the code is merged the channel gets archived silently.
