Hey, we are Noah and Michael, the founders of
0pass.com
. We created 0pass to solve cybersecurity‚Äôs biggest threat - phishing and credential theft.
What‚Äôs the problem?
Passwords and weak two-factor authentication are the leading cause (90%) of security breaches.
Attackers can
easily
steal your passwords, two-factor codes, or even push notifications. Having a fortress of security controls loses its value when
one bad link
could change everything.
How does 0pass help?
We replace traditional login methods like passwords, two-factor codes, and push notifications with more convenient,
phishing-resistant
methods like
Windows Hello
,
TouchID
,
FaceID
, and
Yubikeys
.
Finally, enjoy the same level of security and convenience across Windows, Mac, Linux, and remote, regardless of your employee‚Äôs OS or your existing infrastructure / identity providers.
Can I use 0pass at my company?
We‚Äôre actively working with customers to implement and improve 0pass at their companies - stopping attackers in their tracks.
If you:
Want more convenient and secure login at your company
Want to meet the highest cyber insurance and compliance standards
Want to stop phishing once and for all
