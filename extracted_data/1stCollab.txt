TL;DR
Influencer marketing is one of the most efficient ways to reach and acquire new customers, but itâ€™s tedious to run campaigns. By leveraging machine learning and our prior campaign data, 1stCollab lets you run a campaign in under 30 minutes. Visit

to get started with your next influencer marketing campaign!
Why is influencer marketing hard?
From our time working at large social media platforms, we know that influencer marketing consistently outperforms organic ads. Unfortunately, launching an influencer campaign is a manual and lengthy process.
Launching an influencer campaign takes weeks
, while launching Google ads takes just minutes.
The first step of every influencer campaign is to find the right creators to work withâ€”which often takes over 50 hours per campaign. Existing solutions cost tens of thousands of dollars and operate off inaccurate data. As a result, the majority of influencer marketers spend hours manually searching on YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram. From there, they have to manually calculate stats, vet a creatorâ€™s audience, evaluate past partnerships, and negotiate rates and contract terms, review creatives, report out campaign metrics, and finally submit payments. This whole process often takes 2+ weeks for a single campaign.
How does it work?
1stCollab lets you launch an influencer marketing campaign in minutesâ€”not weeks. All you have to do is find a single influencer who's relevant to your brand and target customers. Then:
Use our
influencer look-alike discovery tool
to identify, vet, and save additional influencers you'd like to work with. We do what the best influencer marketers do: identify a single relevant creator, dig through that creatorâ€™s community, identify additional relevant creators, and repeat the processâ€”but automatically.
Send us your list of saved influencers and tell us about your campaign goals and budget.
We'll take care of everything from there. All you have to do is approve the content that the influencers will post.
We support campaigns on all platforms. Our self-serve discovery tool currently supports YouTube, and weâ€™re launching for Instagram and TikTok soon.
