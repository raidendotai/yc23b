Hi 👋🏾 I’m Namrata, founder of ⚛️⚛️⚛️
Diffuse Bio!
⚛️⚛️⚛️
At Diffuse, we computationally design therapeutics, vaccines, and enzymes better, faster, and cheaper — but most importantly, we generate
molecules that simply can’t be designed with existing methods today
.
The Problem:
Proteins are macromolecules that mediate a significant fraction of the cellular processes that underlie life. An important task in bioengineering is designing proteins with specific 3D structures and chemical properties which enable targeted functions.
So far, computational protein design methods have had some success — but have enormous limitations, the primary one being
low success in downstream validation experiments
. These methods are also painfully slow and scale poorly.
What we do:
For the past several years, I’ve been working on
re-envisioning the computational protein design toolkit with AI
in my PhD and beyond, with the goal of overcoming these challenges. Some highlights are the first crystal structures of
AI-designed proteins
(i.e. experimental validation) and the
first diffusion models
for
protein structure and sequence generation
. Below you can see one of our early models producing structures unconditionally from noise!
Now, we’re
scaling up these methods
and
applying them to grand challenge problems in molecular design
. We’re able to handle a whole array of protein engineering tasks at the
push of a button
— from loop redesign and sequence engineering, all the way to binder design and
de novo
structure generation.

We’d love your help!
If you’re working on any protein or molecular engineering problem, we’d love to hear from you!
We’d love
intros to pharma and biotech companies
working on problems in protein therapeutics, antigen design, and enzyme design.
We’d also love intros to any companies (preferably early stage) doing
high-throughput protein characterization
assays
(yeast display, phage display, etc).
