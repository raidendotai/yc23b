Hi All,
Iâ€™m excited to share
Spadeworks
with you all. Weâ€™re simplifying the chaos of businesses and asset maintenance in India! SpadeWorks provides hassle-free, one stop maintenance solutions for SMBs in India.
For example, restaurant owners can schedule pest control, chimney cleaning, RO maintenance, HVAC maintenance services with just a click of a button instead of coordinating with multiple vendors, which can be time-consuming and lead to increased costs. Our platform uses technology to create standard operating procedures/protocols and accountability mechanisms that ensure transparency, quality, and increased ROI for our customers.
ðŸ’¥ The Problem: Multiple follow-ups with multiple vendors to get things done sucks!
The small and mid-size enterprise maintenance market in India is $40 Bn. Despite its size, itâ€™s highly unorganized and unprofessional.
Common problems faced by the businesses owners
Coordinate with multiple vendors to maintain the property / business
No standard operating procedures for maintenance tasks
No-shows or wrong time commitments
