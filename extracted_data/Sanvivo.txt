⏰ TL;DR
With our mobile app,
VIVOLY
, patients can easily order medication and get them delivered to their doorstep in just 120 minutes.
❌ The problem – buying medication in Europe is inconvenient
For patients:
Medicine is often out of stock
Long waiting times of up to 24h when buying medication
Medication can be purchased at mail-order-pharmacies, but shipping takes several days
For local pharmacies
Pharmacies are barely using digital tools
Orders (if any) are operated using paper notes or fax
Pharmacies can not scale (cap of 4 - 6 pharmacies per owner in Europe)
No digital tools to improve customer loyalty & retention
📈 The European pharmaceutical market is changing rapidly
Telemedicine is expected to grow by 300% by 2027
E-prescription unlocks the market for a new digital patient journey
Pharmacies in Germany are already doing 120M deliveries a year without any digital tools.
✨ Our Solution
With our mobile app,
VIVOLY
, patients can easily order medication and get them delivered to their doorstep in just 120 minutes. Local pharmacies receive these orders in their Point-of-Sale (POS) systems and communicate with the patient via chat.
Vivoly is beneficial, especially for patients with difficulty leaving their homes due to mobility issues or underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infection. The risk of transmission is reduced by allowing patients to order medications online and deliver them directly to their doorstep.
⚙ How it works
In most European countries, franchising is not allowed for pharmacies. Just like individual restaurants, pharmacies in Europe are one-person businesses. Without any state-of-the-art e-commerce solutions, it is tough for local pharmacies to compete with mail-order-pharmacies. This is true even though local pharmacies offer a much faster patient supply.
In Germany alone, there are over 120M deliveries done per year by pharmacies. Those are done without any digital process and are managed mostly manually. Compared to most retailers, pharmacies typically have real-time inventory management.
Sanvivo builds a marketplace that unlocks this existing infrastructure and delivery capabilities to enable a fast “quick-commerce” user experience. With our App,
VIVOLY,
patients order medication and get pharmaceutical advice via chat. Pharmacies are enabled to process those orders through our web app. Then, ready-to-pick-up orders are delivered by riders of the pharmacy using our mobile rider app.
