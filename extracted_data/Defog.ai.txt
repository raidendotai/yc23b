😤 The problem
Insights features within apps take a long time to build and get right.
This is because SaaS founders and product managers spend most of their time on improving their core product. Insights features are rarely top-of-mind, even though they increase user stickiness.
Most teams tell themselves that they will eventually get to it. But they rarely do. The result is a hastily-built dashboard that provides limited insights to users.
🎉
Our solution
We make it super easy to let your users ask questions in natural language and instantly get data and insights on your app.
Defog embeds an intuitive Q&A-style interface for analytics in your app, and lets users query data in seconds.
Some examples of how companies can use Defog:
Fintech companies could provide deep insights based on users’ transaction history.
Video meeting tools could extract common complaints across customer calls and make them easy to discover.
Social media platforms could replace generic analytics dashboards with more specific metrics.
🪄 How it works
Give us the metadata of your database schema (if using SQL), or just unstructured data corpuses (if using APIs or text corpuses)
Add our iframe or Javascript plugin to your app
(optional) set up visual styling for how charts should look on our app
Let your users ask questions of the data, and get insights in seconds
We’re powered by large language models that can search and visualise both structured data (like SQL databases or data warehouses) and unstructured data (like text in call transcripts).
PS: We don’t compromise on privacy 🔐 Our model only needs access to your database schema to work, and not actual data about your customers.
