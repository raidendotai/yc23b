Hi guys!
We are so excited to share our new fundraising CRM!
This is a product that is something we desperately needed, so we built it to help not only us, but the larger startup community. 🥰
The Problem:
As we all know, fundraising can be overwhelming
😩
and hard to keep track of:
Leads can be hard to organize and schedule.
Following up with everyone who contacts us can be difficult!
Research on the caliber and reputation of VCs can be hard to gauge. Do they have a history of investing in companies like us? What are their normal check sizes? 🧐 Who is in their existing portfolio?
We could go on, but you get it– we’ve lived it, after all.
The Solution 😃:
Our new fundraising CRM makes organizing your raise easy by:
Keeping track of your leads, including follow ups and replies.
Making it easy to upload your leads and track them from initial contact to close in a single place
This is particularly useful for anyone who is still fundraising from the S22 batch!
Targeting investors with high conversion rates and larger check sizes 🤑
Providing a clear snapshot of where you are in your goals with our dashboard. 🥳
We just launched and would love any and all feedback on this!
Your time is valuable, so the
first 20 startups
able to get on a zoom call with us will get a
$100 gift card to Amazon.
Much love,
The 8vdX fam❤️
