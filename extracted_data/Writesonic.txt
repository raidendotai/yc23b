ChatSonic is a powerful chatbot, powered by Google Search, allowing it to provide up-to-date and accurate content and hence superior to ChatGPT which can not generate content on topics after September 2021. Additionally, it can create digital images and respond to voice commands and many more additional features. So, ChatSonic has addressed all the limitations of ChatGPT.
ChatSonic can do more than what ChatGPT does:
🌐 Provides up-to-date factual information by using Google's knowledge graph
We've integrated Google search into our chatbot to provide hyper-relevant content on any given topic, so you can always stay up to date.
🎨 Generates digital art and paintings from chat
Chatsonic can also generate stunning digital artwork and images using AI so that you can bring your ideas to life.
🗣️ Understands voice commands and talks back responses like Siri
Why write when you can speak? Ask ChatSonic what you need via voice commands and have it read back the responses to you, just like Siri or Google Assistant does—you’ll be surprised!
🧠 Maintains the context of your conversations. Feels like you’re talking to a human
ChatSonic maintains the context of your conversations just like you would with a person. It remembers past questions or comments in your conversation and can easily answer follow-up questions.
🔗 Gives you the option to share, edit, or download your conversations
Share a specific response or even your entire conversations with your friends, colleagues, family, and followers.
🦸 Talk to a Personalized Avatar
Talk with your own personal avatar! Select your personality - English tutor, fitness trainer, Math teacher, and more - and ChatSonic will behave like them, providing accurate answers.
👨‍💻 Provides an API
ChatSonic can be integrated with other applications and services through our simple-to-use API.
