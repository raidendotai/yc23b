ü§î What‚Äôs the problem?
Many of us have experienced the pains of internal tooling in startups and scale-ups. From a management point of view, engineering resources dedicated to internal tooling are wasted as they should be focusing on customer-facing products. For developers, it‚Äôs a chore to work on unloved parts of the codebase that aren‚Äôt a priority for the business. And for other stakeholders in Product, Ops and Support, there‚Äôs never enough capacity to build the tools they desperately need, while the ones they have are slow, cluttered and the UX is often poor.
üôå How does Noloco help?
Noloco
is the no-code platform for teams to instantly create internal tools from databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Airtable & Google Sheets.
Once you connect your data source (e.g. PostgreSQL), Noloco automatically builds an app for you from your chosen tables including collection views (e.g. tables and kanban boards), record pages to view individual records and forms to add new records.
Noloco provides a totally no-code builder. This genuinely makes building and configuring internal tools 10x faster. With our no-code first approach, Noloco also removes the reliance on engineers whenever your Ops, Customer Support, Product or Sales team want to make any changes or add new tools.
