Teachers are increasingly overworked and ridiculously underserved. Flint aims to change that by creating AI tools built from the ground up with one goal in mind: helping teachers (

With Flint, K-12 teachers can…
create content in seconds,
differentiate to student needs,
and align to curriculum standards.
All supercharged with AI.
We’re Jinseo (left) and Sohan (right). We previously built a startup in the video chat space during the pandemic, and are now excited to be working with K-12 teachers!
