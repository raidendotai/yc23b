Retention is the new Growth! 🚀
💬 Words Matter 💬
Everyday customers tell their vendors exactly what they want, but nobody's listening.  In fact, businesses continue to archive mountains of Customer Success emails, Sales call transcripts, marketing chatbot data and technical support conversations across disparate platforms that aren’t connected.  Imagine the customer experience you could provide by unlocking the value of knowing
exactly what your customer needs, when they want it.
B2B conversational data is the most underutilized asset in a business’s revenue strategy.  Vector is on a mission to tell a sales rep what they need to upsell or retain a customer in 30 seconds, based on months of multi-channel conversations.
We are Joshua and Nick, former Sales Engineering executives who’ve identified preventable problems in B2B customer experience, where the answers lay within the unstructured conversational data.
✅
The Solution: Vector
✅
In the Future:
Vector will be the solution to the often sought after Customer 360.  Based on conversational analytics, Vector will aggregate, analyze, and provide the ability for your teams to create an experience that your customers desire.
We will provide the “R” in CRM that does not exist today.
Short-term:
Far too often, Sales Representatives and CSMs change accounts leaving their customers in a position of starting over with someone new.  The process of repeating answers to the same questions asked in the past is an awful experience, and a massive waste of time.  Vector makes sense of your unstructured conversational data so that, AE to AE or Pre-Sales to Post-Sales knowledge transfers are executed as if the same person is working the account.
