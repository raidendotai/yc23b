⚡️TL;DR
Communication of software systems is hard, visuals help but often lack consistency and are out-of-date within weeks.
IcePanel is a SaaS tool for tech teams to collaborate on their software architecture design.
👋 Who are we?
Hey all, we’re
Victor
and
Jacob
, the founders of 🧊
IcePanel
.
🤬 Problem
Software teams currently use generic diagramming tools to communicate complex systems.
Software systems are becoming increasingly complex and are hard to explain.
Technical teams often find it challenging to tell the right story and gain alignment.
Technical diagrams are inconsistent, lack context and drift from reality - becoming out-of-date in a matter of weeks.
Engineering and product teams are often misaligned, especially in technical areas.
💩 Bad communication across teams is time-consuming and expensive.
🚀 Our solution
Help humans visually communicate complex systems; linked to resources in reality.
1️⃣ Modelling
IcePanel is a collaborative modelling tool, that provides a single source of truth with reusable objects and relationships, keeping your diagrams in sync and up-to-date with changes.
2️⃣ Consistent language
IcePanel is built upon the
C4 model
, a lightweight layered approach designed for technical and non-technical audiences. This brings consistency to visual & verbal communication about software architecture.
3️⃣ Linked to reality
IcePanel objects can be linked to resources in reality, such as files in Git, that flag as out-of-date if they no longer exist.
