Hello everyone, we are
Aseem
&
Vimal
, the team behind
qoohoo
.
Problem
Communities on Telegram and WhatsApp have been growing at a rapid pace, especially in the last few years. Creators tend to bring their audience from social media to messaging apps, but they don't have a way to monetize or manage them effectively.
They are currently managing their backend operations in a chaotic, error-prone, and time-consuming way, manually handling payments and adding/removing users separately.
Besides monetisation, creators need help with
audience growth, retention
, and
reactivation
.
They are missing critical audience insights, behaviour and nudges to grow their business effectively to their full potential.
This problem was first faced by Vimal while running his edtech startup - coursavy, where communities of students & LIVE courses were the core. He used to create a telegram channel for each course and manually managed the operations. His brother is also a
YouTuber in music learning
facing similar issues while running classes on Whatsapp.
This experience gave us a ring-side view of the problem and the scale.
Solution
Creators on qoohoo can quickly launch their micro-content, courses & subscriptions directly on Whatsapp and Telegram unlocking massive growth potential.
If we take simplicity & speed into account,
what whatsapp is for personal communication, qoohoo is for creators. It‚Äôs that simple!
In February alone, our creators are earning close to
$500K
in the field of Art, Music, Education and Finance.
One of our
creators‚Äô earnings has surged from
$10K
to
$125K
per month in just 10 months of using our product. She leverages YouTube for distribution and qoohoo for monetization.
