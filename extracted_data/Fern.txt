TLDR
: Fern generates useful artifacts for your API, like SDKs, docs, and server code.

Problem
When building APIs, we spent a lot of our time doing things like:
Writing types & networking logic on the backend
Communicating details of the API endpoints over Slack
Re-writing the
same
types & networking logic on the frontend
Re-writing the
same
types & networking logic in each SDK or client library
Re-writing the
same
information in our docs & Postman Collection
Inevitably, these multiple sources of truth get out of sync, causing runtime bugs, wasted hours of debugging, and frustration.
Solution
Fern
productizes schema-first API design. You define the schema of your API (or give us an OpenAPI spec) and we generate:
SDKs
in popular programming languages. Our SDKs feel handwritten. They can be used externally for customers or internally for your frontend/microservices.
API docs
that sync to your provider of choice.
Postman Collection
complete with examples of successful and unsuccessful requests
Server-side validation
to make sure that you serve the API you promised.
Fern also registers all versions of your API in a registry ‚Äî no need to ping a coworker over Slack to understand how to consume an API.
