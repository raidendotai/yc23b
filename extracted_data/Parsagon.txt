tl;dr: Parsagon now offers real-time price indexes by scraping daily prices of retailers.
Parsagon is an AI that can auto-generate web scrapers and data pipelines. With inflation affecting so many consumers and businesses, we had our AI generate dozens of scrapers to collect prices and track inflation for over 50,000 food products across 38 cities in North America. You can access daily inflation estimates per food category (e.g., bread, seafood) and per region (e.g., Northeast U.S., Western U.S.) via our API. For example, here’s the change in price for various foods in the U.S. over the past week:
