Hi Everyone👋 , we are super excited to launch Waveline! 🤙
📖 TLDR
Waveline
helps companies integrate AI into their business without any prior machine learning experience. Our customers use us to categorize e-mails and documents, interact with databases, and build custom AI pipelines.
❌ Problem
Unstructured data (e.g. documents, images, even audio files) is a hassle. Fortunately, recent AI technologies allow for handling such data much more efficiently, but it is a big step from validating those use cases with
ChatGPT
to implementing those ideas in production.
💡 Solution
Waveline is a flow-based tool to prototype, design, and deploy AI, no matter how much ML experience you have. You can easily integrate us into your existing codebases by calling our API with in- and outputs you define, or use the shareable web interface that we automatically generate.
And the best thing?
We provide production-ready hosting for you and take care of the scaling.
For example, if you’d like to
handle incoming customer requests
with logic specific to your business, here is what such a flow could look like.
📹 Video
In this demo, we create a flow that
extracts the important information from email orders
, saves them as a JSON, and sends it to your database.
😴 Backstory
Before Waveline we built
Generai
, where we pioneered our own text-to-image pipeline at the very front of generative AI. We noticed how cumbersome it is to get AI products from idea to production, so our mission is to bring these learnings to everyone.
