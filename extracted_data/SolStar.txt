Hey YC community! ðŸ‘‹ Weâ€™re Ryan and Drew, and weâ€™re building SolStar ðŸŒŸ
SolStar builds easy-to-use crypto tools for Discord communities. Our first product, SolStar Tip Bot, is like Venmo for Discord: send crypto to your friends with just a few clicks.
The problem with crypto
Crypto is confusing and intimidating, with no clear entry point for beginners. To purchase crypto from scratch, a new user needs to:
Know what a crypto wallet is
Know where to sign up for one
Understand KYC and buy crypto on an exchange
Transfer from exchange to wallet
Manage to not lose their seed phrase
If these steps confuse you, youâ€™re not alone. Itâ€™s even confusing to experts. This is ridiculous, and it leaves out 99.9% of internet users who arenâ€™t heavy technical adopters.
SolStar makes crypto easy ðŸŒŸ
SolStar makes it possible for anyone to use cryptoâ€”even your grandpa!
All you need to get started is a credit card. Skip the confusing steps above and dive in right away with a secure, approachable tool that makes crypto fun. You can add SolStar Tip Bot to your Discord, check your balance, and send a tip to a friend all within a few minutes.
When you use SolStar, youâ€™ll get a secure custodial wallet and easy access to your balance on our site.
Another feature weâ€™re excited about - you can now buy tokens directly in Discord! Make it easy to join your community - no crypto experience required.
As an added bonus, you can interact with our Ask an AI tool, which features various personalities, including Antagonistic Viking, Honorable Julius Caesar, or Confused Isaac Newton.
How It All Began âœ¨
Weâ€™re a couple of software engineers who love crypto and gaming. Weâ€™ve spent more all-nighters than we can count hanging out in Discord, and weâ€™re big fans of how itâ€™s a user-friendly space to build community.
We wanted crypto to be more accessible and fun. Thereâ€™s no better way to onboard people to crypto than to create a simple way for them to start using it in their own communities.
We wished we had something like SolStar, so we built it ourselves.
