TL;DR:
Roforco
is a Roblox game studio that creates consistent hits by mass producing games - like a game factory! We acquire and complete unfinished projects, then cross promote them within our portfolio.
Hey !
ðŸ‘‹
Tom
and
Brain
(aka. the Roblox guys) here to introduce
Roforco
!

The Problem
Thereâ€™s over 200bn$ in (video) gaming. Individual games can pull in hundreds of millions annually. Investors love this opportunity, but
itâ€™s impossible to predict if a studioâ€™s next title will be popular
, make money back or land well.
Games are expensive to make and are inconsistently successful.
This is called hit based risk, or as we dubbed it â€˜hit-riskâ€™
ðŸ¤”
Why Roblox?
There will always be at least one popular platform people make games for
. At the moment, itâ€™s Roblox with a 2bn$ market and over 200mm MAU. Weâ€™re also deeply familiar with the platform, having
previously built an agency that grossed 500k$ of revenue in 6 mo
and partnered with brands including Unilever.
ðŸ”Ž
The Insight
Indie game developers
have a tendency to never finish projects they start.
After doing the fun parts like the game loop, closing out the game for release is often too difficult, boring and resource intensive. Every game developer (on Roblox) that we know has  at least 2 unfinished or abandoned projects.
There are 10 million developers registered on Roblox in comparison to 44k on Steam.
Compared to the years AAA takes to produce one title (or 6-18 months in mobile),
on Roblox the average time to develop a game can be as little as 2-3 months.
ðŸŽ‰
There's a Solution!
We work with these unfinished/abandoned games and weâ€™re able to acquire/ receive
a share of these projects
, while
partnering with the original developer
who is usually
glad to work together
just to see their vision come to life.
This gives us a much bigger market of unfinished games to acquire and mass
produce for faster and cheaper.
Meanwhile, the original developer gets to make money back from their idea at a fraction of the time and effort.
Effectively - itâ€™s the revenue of gaming with the predictability of B2B SaaS!
ðŸ¤¯
What next?
Once at least a game takes off, it
proves the validity of itâ€™s idea.
Then we can dedicate larger, longterm resources and grow the gameâ€™s IP exponentially, turning it into a
multimedia franchise (movies, toys, etc) building more revenue streams beyond the game.
