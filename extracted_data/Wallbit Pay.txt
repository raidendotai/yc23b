TL;DR:
Wallbit is a Neobank for global remote workers. We give non-US residents a bank account in the US where they can receive their income, and withdraw in crypto and local currencies around the world.
Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹, we are happy to introduce Wallbit!
ðŸ™ƒ The Problem:
As an international worker, you have to figure out ways to receive payments and withdraw money locally. Some banks in Latin America donâ€™t even support US dollars, and the
US financial products are not so accessible if you donâ€™t live there!
ðŸŒŽ The Solution:
âš¡ One-Stop Neobank for all the needs of remote workers âš¡
Wallbit not only helps you receive payments, but also helps you get immediate liquidity.
Imagine receiving an ACH/Wire bank transfer from your client/employer in your Wallbit account, and then having those funds available in your bank account in your country in just 5 minutesâ€¦
sounds good, right? Thatâ€™s exactly what we do.
Now, take a look to the rest of our features:
Receive ACH/Wire and Swift bank transfers âœ…
Receive payments from payroll platforms like Deel, OnTop âœ…
Convert and withdraw in crypto or local currencies âœ…
Get access to a virtual US debit card âœ…
Invest in the stock market and US treasuries âœ…
Yep, all that, and itâ€™s live already, no waitlists! Sign up in
app.wallbit.io
and get access to your US bank account for free.
ðŸ’ª Why us?
We are a team of software engineers from Argentina who have faced this problem for years while working remotely for US companies. Weâ€™re combining all that understanding of the problem with our tech expertise to fill the banking gap between the US and the rest of the world.
