Enveloop - Build and send messages with a single API.
We help developers build & send well-crafted emails & texts from their apps -- we're doing for mailer libraries what Prisma did for ORMs.

Hey, we’re Ben and Jason! (S11 / W20)
We’re announcing
Enveloop
— a developer-focused
message builder
and
API
that makes it easy to design & send beautiful emails and texts from your app using one simple implementation. And you don’t have to be a designer — we’re focused on making developers look awesome. 🤩
📣 Why We Built Enveloop
Developers create apps. Apps need to talk to users. Simple, right? Unfortunately — multiple APIs, maintaining message content, design standards, delivery standards, handling failure/retry -- you have to figure it all out, and, over time,
it all becomes scattered in your code.
Worse
— the content is inaccessible to those that need to edit it because it’s mixed with the design & implementation — buried in your code with all that other complexity. That puts
you
in the middle of any update, big or small. Gross.
We’ve built a graceful service that solves this. It’s simple for developers, collaborative for consultants and their clients, and ready for fast-moving product & development teams.
It’s Enveloop.
💪 Our Solution
With Enveloop, we offer developers:
A powerful & friendly-to-use message builder.
Loads of elegantly-designed templates to get you started quickly.
Intuitive formatting built with developers in mind (markdown, mustache, etc.)
A single API that supports multiple message types and providers.
Easy delegation of message content to others on your team (or to your clients!)
All this helps to
remove unnecessary code/complexity
from your app and
reduces superficial deployments
. And more is on the way, including support for additional message types and useful message analytics.
