Why does Jaldi exist?
While the last five years saw a fivefold increase in US online grocery penetration, little has changed for South Asians living in the US. Few South Asian supermarkets offer delivery and often struggle on inventory and quality when they do. Selection online can often be expensive, elusive, and leave the customer wanting for more.
The South Asian consumer deserves better. That’s why I started Jaldi.
South Asians in the US are the highest earning and fastest growing ethnic demographic - yet there are few shopping experiences that cater specifically to them. Jaldi is building the first-class e-commerce experience for the South Asian diaspora. The next wave in retail will be cultural commerce, how communities shop and interact with what they buy. Jaldi is leading the way in this emerging space.

Why am I the one building this?
I’ve spent my life in this space. I grew up in South Asian supermarkets - my family runs a large chain in the US. My first job out of college was working on Amazon’s grocery business, wearing many hats over the few years I spent there. Most recently, I was the Head of US Strategy & Expansion for Uber’s Grocery business. I’ve seen the grocery industry (and specifically the South Asian consumables space) from multiple angles and see the opportunity to build an amazing customer experience here.

. Great work! Thank you for your business
Sunny!!! I got the groceries. Seamless process, actually so smooth.
Honestly, I had never stepped foot into a South Asian supermarket and didn't know what to expect. Ordered some of the recommended products, now I can't get enough of Thums Up and Kurkure!
