Hi everyone, thanks for stopping by our launch YC post. We are Rob and Jack and we are on a mission to power the low-carbon transition through methane monitoring.
💨
Why methane I hear you ask?
Methane emissions from the energy industry, if prevented would have the climate impact equivalent to taking all cars and trucks off the road globally. It is a short-lived pollutant, therefore stopping this gas getting to the atmosphere is one of the best levers we have in the climate change mitigation fight.
🚫
The Problem: Poor data on understanding where emissions occur
Existing data collection processes are manual, involving hand-held cameras on a site, expensive and not frequently available on all 12 million oil & gas assets globally. Poor data collection processes mean poor data.
Existing methane inventories under-represent methane emissions by around 70%. This is preventing sustainability and risk analysts from managing emissions in their global energy portfolios. Mismanagement of these emissions can lead to stock devaluations, stranded assets and increases global warming.
⭐
The solution: Global and frequent methane emissions data
Orbio helps sustainability and risk analysts identify where in their large energy portfolios the biggest methane emission risks are. Identifying previously unknown risks and doing this on a frequent basis gives these analysts the tools to effectively manage emission risks.
🤖
How it works: Processing non-methane emission satellite data
Orbio leverages the power of satellite data. We have developed an algorithm capable of processing data from satellites not previously designed to monitor methane emissions. Using these satellites enables us to deliver world-leading data across global scales, at an asset level (e.g. an oil well) and on a frequent basis.

The opportunity: A growing market being pulled by new regulation
A sweep of regulation being introduced across the globe in 2023. This is putting pressure on the energy industry, financial professionals and insurers, totalling around 60,000 companies worldwide, to get a better understanding of what the associated emission risks in their energy portfolios.
