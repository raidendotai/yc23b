TLDR

Customize and chain together models to analyze text data, automate accurate and up to date web research without scraping, and power company research that goes beyond common datasets like Pitchbook and Crunchbase.
ü§î The Problem:
Data-driven teams know that research takes time and great research takes even longer. Whether working with text or gathering accurately sourced insights on companies or new markets. They also know that exporting a CSV and sorting rows is the fastest way to accomplish goals quickly and build reports.
Spreadsheets work well because every business is different, but they
weren‚Äôt designed for unstructured text
data that is the lifeblood of effective Sales and Marketing teams.
