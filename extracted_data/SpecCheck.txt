❌ The Problem: Current optical industry software sucks!
Did you know it takes a coordinated team of eye doctors, opticians, technicians, and an optical lab to successfully dispense a
single pair
of prescription eyeglasses? Despite this complex balancing act, each of these groups are forced to use antiquated technology and systems built in the 1990s that are fragmented, outdated, and limited to specific use cases. This results in glasses taking longer than they should to reach the patient, and results in expensive remakes. Not-so-fun fact: one in ten pairs of glasses needs to be redone before they are ready for pick up.

⭐ Why Us?
Joe
began his career in the optical industry in 2012, working as an optician for several different offices. In 2016 he was recruited to work for a key industry player, Shamir Insight, and afterwards for Johnson & Johnson Vision as a sales executive. As he traversed the industry in various roles, Joe realized that thousands of other eye doctors and optical labs were suffering from the same problems and frustrations he had encountered during his career.
When Joe approached his friend
Arnold
about creating a new technology resource to unify the fragmented optical industry, Arnold was quick to see the vision (pun intended). Arnold’s career started at Workday building the infrastructure for an internal job scheduler. Most recently, Arnold was the lead staff engineer for the payments infrastructure and processing teams at Lyft. With his diverse experience designing scalable and easy-to-use technology solutions for millions of users, Joe and Arnold make the perfect co-founding team.
