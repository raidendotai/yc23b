The Problem
Although
50-70%
of organizations have already adopted Kubernetes, most developers agree that it is too complex and difficult to manage. It is intended to be extremely flexible in order to solve pretty much everyone‚Äôs needs, however, it can take a ton of work and many auxiliary tools to get there.
As companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3rd party tools via custom internal tools.
Our Solution
We give you an ‚Äúinternal developer platform‚Äù out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes.
We do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use.
We operate on your code and in your Cloud environment, so you‚Äôre never locked in and never restricted, as is common with classic PaaS offerings.
If you prefer a fully hosted environment like Heroku, Fly or Vercel, we‚Äôll host a cluster for you and offer you a one-click migration to your own cluster whenever you want.
