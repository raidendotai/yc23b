Hi YC! This is
Talia
and
John
from TorMagnus.
WHO WE ARE
At TorMagnus, we’re finding the converging pathways and proteins involved in disease, starting with Parkinson’s disease. We do so by leveraging the scientific and computational approaches behind network medicine. We are collaborating with a renowned Parkinson's lab to validate our findings. Our therapeutic foothold is Parkinson’s disease, but our platform is applicable to a wide range of other diseases.
TorMagnus is named after Talia’s best friend. Tor, and patients like him who suffer from devastating diseases, serve as our inspiration to contribute to therapeutic innovation.
THE SCIENCE
Network medicine is a multidisciplinary approach that aims to understand and treat diseases by analyzing the complex interactions between biological systems and networks, rather than by focusing solely on individual genes, proteins, or cells.
One key aspect of network medicine is the identification of drug targets, which are molecules or cellular components that can be modulated by drugs to treat or prevent a disease. Traditional drug discovery approaches often target single molecules or pathways, which can be limited in their efficacy and can lead to unwanted side effects. In contrast, network medicine approaches consider the entire biological system and its interconnected networks, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.
By analyzing the molecular interactions and pathways involved in a disease, network medicine can identify key nodes or hubs in the network that are critical for disease development and progression. These nodes may be targeted with drugs to disrupt the network and halt or reverse the disease process.
We are harnessing the power of network medicine to identify novel drug targets by revealing the interconnectedness of different biological pathways and identifying nodes that have not been previously targeted.
