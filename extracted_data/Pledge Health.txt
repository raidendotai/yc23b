Hi! Weâ€™re Shreya and Andrew, the team behind
Pledge Health
.
TL;DR
Pledge automates patient billing for independent healthcare clinics. We estimate how much insurance will cover for each visit, so clinics can charge patients at the time of service, rather than waiting weeks for insurance to process.
ðŸ¤¯
The Problem
A larger share of healthcare clinicsâ€™ revenue is coming from patients instead of insurance companies, so clinics are trying to charge patients upfront for care. However, the manual process of estimating how much a patient will pay after insurance is error-prone, expensive, and time-consuming.
Take Dr. Emily for example; she
spends more than 20 cents to collect every $1 from a patient
. Despite the high cost and effort, her office is only able to collect 50% of the patient's responsibility at the time of the visit.
There are over 200k clinic owners like Dr. Emily in the US,
struggling to collect $47 billion in patient payments
every year.

Our Solution
Automatically verifies patient insurance benefits ahead of their appointment.
Creates personalized out-of-pocket cost estimates by combining the patientâ€™s insurance benefits, the predicted services for the visit, and contracted prices.
Communicates the estimated cost and final bills clearly with patients via email and text and allows patients to schedule payments.
ðŸ“ˆÂ Results with Pledge
Reduce time spent on collecting patient responsibility by 75%
Increase collections by 17%
See > 90% patient satisfaction
