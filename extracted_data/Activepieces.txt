Hi everyone!
We're
Mohammad
(ex-Google) and
Ashraf
(3x founder), and here is what we’re building 👇
💔
Problem
It can quickly get
too expensive 💰
to use automation tools like Zapier, and if you can’t or hate to
send your data to 3rd parties
🔒
it’s already challenging to use these tools.
🕺
Our Product
Activepieces is a no-code business automation tool. It’s open-source (MIT licensed) and can be self-hosted on your servers.
Here is a 2-min video by our founding engineer Abdul, who’ll explain how to automate sending notifications about a new
Pipedrive
Person to
Slack
and
Email
.
❇️
Difference from Zapier
While Zapier offers a cloud service, Activepieces is:
Self-hosted:
You can keep your data on your servers (helpful for data privacy).
Open-source:
the platform and the connectors (don’t wait for us to build the connector).
Free
(helpful for .. your pocket).

Use Cases
We’re working with some users at companies to:
Automate lead flow: from blogs to MailChimp and CRMs.
Centralize notifications: from marketing/sales to Slack workspace.
Automate operations: a company is using us to convert pdfs to text, summarize them and submit them to their proofreading team.
🟢
Status
We just launched with
15 apps
including OpenAI, HubSpot, MailChimp, Stripe, Pipedrive, Gmail, SendGrid — and adding more.
Our focus is to build the free product and the community around it. Later, we’ll make money from enterprise features.
🙏
