TL;DR
Sherloq is a collaborative SQL repository, like Github for data teams, that creates one source of truth for all company queries using Gen AI. With Sherloq, different data analysts are asked the same question and they always give the same answer.

Hey everyone 👋 We’re
Alon (CTO)
,
Noy (CEO)
and
Nadav (COO).
We’re happy to introduce Sherloq - the first collaborative SQL repository for data users.

Inconsistencies in data analysis destroy business value, and costs orgs more than $15M per year
With the adoption of the modern data stack and while companies store endless amounts of data, data teams (analysts, scientists and engineers) spend 60% of their time trying to find, understand and manage their data.
Data analysis is still very subjective and dependent on the user creating it:
Company business metrics are interpreted differently by each data user, and have various definitions
Structured data consist of hundreds of out-of-date fields with similar names, making it almost impossible to determine the most relevant fields for a particular analysis
Since SQL code is stored locally on each data user’s computer and isn’t reused, every data user writes code their own way regardless of company best practices
The rise of Gen AI changes the rules of the game, as now it enables us to take data explainability to a new level of clarity, a capability we only wish we had a few months back.
As we ourselves were data users in companies such as Microsoft, Walkme and 8200 the Cyber Intelligence Unit at the IDF, we’ve experienced this problem firsthand and waited for a proper solution for too long.
