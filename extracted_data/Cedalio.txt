How do we do it:
Verifiable data:
field-level certifications offers a means to validate the data's integrity, creating trust and assurance in the accuracy of the information.
On chain access controls
: the access control rules are stored in a smart contract, ensuring a censorship-resistant database.
On chain log:
by recording a detailed log of transactions on the blockchain, we enable auditability and the ability to reconstruct the database if needed.
