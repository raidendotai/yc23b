TL;DR
We're building
Cardda
, the simplest way for Latam companies to make their payments. We give corporate credit cards, tools for bill payments and automated local transfers.
Hi everyone! 👋 We are Sebastián and Cristóbal, and would love to tell you about
Cardda
.
Problem
Businesses are wasting a lot of time paying other businesses, it's common to hear questions like: who approved this invoice?, who initiated this payment?, should we pay the supplier this week or next week?
Employee expenses and reimbursements: receipts lost, reconciliation time consuming, visibility on payments weeks after purchases made, no control over what employees can pay and no budgets
Corporate cards are slow to obtain, have poor spending controls and transactions aren't incorporated with company's accounting systems
Solution
We enable companies to
initiate, track and reconcile every payment
they make to other businesses, using the local payments methods accepted by business and showing all the accounts payable in real time through direct integration with each country's invoice system.
API and dashboard to
automate mass local payouts.
Unlimited physical and virtual corporate credit cards
with granular controls to pay for their expenses, real time visibility in each purchase, set spending controls and option to block merchants.
