Hey everyone! We’re Ryder, Matthew, Curtis, Manish, Veneta, and Sean aka the team behind
Whalesync
.
The problem: connecting tools is hard
Connecting apps like Airtable & Webflow enables amazing use cases, but is actually really hard to do without code!
We started Whalesync because we repeatedly saw people spending weeks architecting multi-step automations only to find them brittle and unreliable.
While we love automation tools, they’re really not built to handle true data syncing where you connect deeply and bi-directionally.
The solution: simple, no-code data sync
Whalesync is the no-code tool built to handle data syncing. In a few minutes, you can hook up your apps and have them 2-way syncing in real-time.
Use cases: pSEO, internal tools, + much more
Whalesync works by connecting different tools, so there are a TON of different things you can do. A few of the more popular use cases:
🔎 Launch thousands of
programmatic SEO pages
(Airtable x Webflow)
⚒️ Build an
internal tool
on top of your production database (Postgres x Notion)
💻 Create a scalable
no-code app
(Bubble x Airtable)
🧑 Personalize hundreds of tier-1
ABM landing pages
(Airtable x Webflow)
📝 Manage your
blog
(Notion x Webflow)
