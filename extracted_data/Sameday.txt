Super thrilled to share Sameday with all of you!
Our customers say they’ve never heard anything like it, and that’s the point. People love talking to Sameday’s virtual sales agents. Not only does Sameday sound ultra-human, but it acknowledges a customer’s pain, overcomes objections, and follows up until the sale is made. With a close rate of 80%.
Yes, you read that right.
Sameday’s virtual sales agent closes 80% of all sales calls it receives.
❌ The Problem
Home service businesses fail to answer 62% of phone calls.
Paying 4X more per lead than any other industry, missing just one sales call costs $80 on average.
Third-party call centers are expensive.
Averaging several dollars per minute, they also fail schedule services effectively; resulting in low sold to service rates and an even higher cost per acquisition. (Most of Sameday’s customers switched from a third-party call center)
Staffing is difficult.
Most hire family and friends to answer the phone, while others attempt to answer it themselves…while on the job…covered in who knows what. Some have large call centers, struggling to balance an acceptable ROI and the turnover that comes with a call center. (Many Sameday customers have call centers with 50+ employees)
✅ The Solution
A virtual sales agent that answers any phone calls your team would otherwise miss. But it doesn’t stop there…
Sameday follows up, initiating outbound calls on its own to ensure every lead gets on the schedule.
Combine that with Sameday’s ability to onboard new customers in seconds, ultra-human voice, which we call, “Pro Voice”, and the ability to overcome objections, Sameday eliminates all the common pitfalls of other AI solutions, resulting in our customers saying, “Wow”.
