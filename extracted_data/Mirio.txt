Hi everyone, weâ€™re
David Correa
and
Eric Li
, the founders of Mirio.
Mirio is a demo platform for sales teams at API companies. Instead of bugging engineers to build custom demos or screen-sharing documentation, sales teams can use our no code-platform to clone, deploy, and personalize demo apps in minutes.
For sales teams selling API products
We spoke to account executives and SDRs at API companies and heard the same problems:
Developers are okay with documentation but decision-makers want to visualize the impact on their business and product.
Sales tries to convince engineers and designers to create custom demos but are usually told no (When David and I were asked to help create demos, we hated it too)
As a result, they only personalize demos for top prospects and end up demoing the same documentation and code for most customers, which often doesnâ€™t land.
Create personalized demos in minutes with Mirio
Mirio empowers sales teams to spin-up and personalize real apps (connected to your API) so they can convey the magic of your product to every customer.
Connect your demo apps to Mirio, weâ€™ll help you set them up so they can be customized.
From your Mirio dashboard, account executives and SDRs can clone and deploy demo apps in one click. They can then personalize branding, content, and more using our no-code editor.
Use your personalized demos in live meetings, SDR outreach, website embeds, leave-behinds, and more. Track demo engagement from your dashboard.
Wow more customers and close more deals!

Why us?
David and Eric met at as early employees of Bread Financial (NYSE: BFH) where the sales team bugged us every week to help create custom demos for Breadâ€™s developer-facing product. This was time-consuming and painful but we saw the impact that personalized, interactive demos had on closing deals.
Outside of Bread, weâ€™ve also built software, designed products, and led teams at companies like Google, Microsoft, Uber, and Vareto.
