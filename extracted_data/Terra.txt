What is
Terra
An API that makes it super easy for apps to connect to wearables and sensors.
Many of our customers have been asking for an easy way to generate recommendations, so we connected with ChatGPT and made it possible.
The way it works:
1. You upload your recommendations
2. We prompt ML models and optimize them for your app
3. You receive the recommendations through our API
This can be for your sleep, mental health, nutrition, training, and overall health app!
