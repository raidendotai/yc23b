What does LinkGrep do?
üîó Automatically keeps track of all of your teams links
LinkGrep automatically keeps track of all of your links and ranks them by viewership across your team. This allows you to easily stay on top of every important document. LinkGrep also provides a command palette that is available on every site to help you navigate the browser more quickly.
‚ú® Suggests information from your knowledge bases while you browse

LinkGrep can automatically connect the dots for you and will display related information from your browser history + team knowledge bases (like Slack & Notion) while you browse. LinkGrep also offers traditional semantic search if you ever want to manually search for things too.
ü§ñ Opens up the right links before your meetings

LinkGrep can figure out what links and tabs you need before your meeting and automatically opens them up for you. Everyone on your team will be on the same page when a meeting starts.
üë• Makes collaboration easier through contextual notes on webpages
Collaborate directly from webpages. Leave notes, tag teammates, and more. You will no longer need to context switch to other apps or copy paste links to collaborate.
