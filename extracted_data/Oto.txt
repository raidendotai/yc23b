Hi YC, Ed and George here, the founders of
Oto
. Last year we launched our mobile app as a one size fits all solution for tinnitus.
We've since spoken to hundreds of users and it's clear that they need a more personalised approach, with live support from a real person. So, we are thrilled to announce our new 1-1 therapy program.
Tl;dr:
Oto teaches your brain to stop noticing your tinnitus using the latest scientifically proven techniques. Our personalised program combines 1-1 therapy from a world class audiologist with an award winning app.

❗
Why do we exist?
Tinnitus or ringing in the ears affects 1 in 8 people,
and there’s no cure
. It impacts mood, concentration and sleep and in 40% of cases is hugely debilitating.
Getting reliable help is not easy. People usually drift between ENT doctors or audiologists searching for effective treatment. Nearly all are told that they need to learn to live with it.
However, it shouldn’t be like this.
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been proven to be the most effective way to manage tinnitus.
Unfortunately, not many clinicians are aware of this, and in the US, CBT can only be delivered by a licensed therapist. Very few therapists are trained to deliver CBT for tinnitus specifically.
Hear from our lead therapist Anna Pugh why we built the program.
Anna is a hearing therapist audiologist specialising in tinnitus therapy.
💡 How does it work?
Right now if you have tinnitus, it probably makes you feel anxious, sad or angry. That’s normal.
CBT changes that emotional reaction so that you stop perceiving the tinnitus to be a threat. Two things then happen:
✔️ You stop noticing your tinnitus all the time.
✔️ If you do notice it, it doesn’t make you feel bad.
