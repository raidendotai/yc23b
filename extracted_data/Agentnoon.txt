👋 Hey YC!
Ali and Dave here, co-founders of Agentnoon (W22).
tl;dr
Agentnoon helps you take control of headcount spend
“Agentnoon helps us save money and increase efficiency by accurately tracking headcount spend against approved budget for different roles, regions, and pay scales, as well as comp changes, promotions, and backfills/staff transitions. This lets us reduce overspending while empowering our managers and leaders to make the best decisions within their approved budgets.” CEO, Series B YC startup

💰 saving money with efficient budgets (10%+ savings on headcount budget)
