Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
Weâ€™re James, Matt, Eric & Dan and weâ€™re building
API Hero
. Weâ€™re on a mission to make using and working with APIs
super easy.
ðŸ¤¦Â The problem
There are two major headaches weâ€™re tackling:
Slow APIs dramatically reduce the speed of your site, and adding caching to solve this can be hard
Debugging API issues is painful. You want full visibility of requests and responses so you can figure out whatâ€™s going on, during development and production (although we make production logging optional)
ðŸ¦¸Â With API Hero, you can:
Monitor all your API traffic (or just the parts you want)
Speed up every API you use by enabling caching (this can also save you money!)
Get alerts when issues arise
Improve reliability with automatic retries
ðŸ› Â How does API Hero work?
Login to
API Hero
(itâ€™s free!)
Follow the simple onboarding steps â€“ weâ€™ll automatically populate your dashboard as soon as a request is sent
Configure the settings to proxy only the traffic you want
Sit back and watch those logs come in!
ðŸ’¬Â Weâ€™d love to chat to:
Anyone suffering from API issues
Any company working with 3rd-party APIs or building APIs
Anyone whoâ€™s checked out API Hero and has feedback
