Hey everyone! We‚Äôre Aditya and Karan! üëã
Warrant is an open source
authorization service
that
helps developers implement and enforce secure, compliant access control in their applications.
It abstracts away the complexity of building application authorization and access control so developers can instead focus on building core product features.
Our cloud-first, API-first approach has enabled us to build a highly-scalable and performant service that now processes millions of customer API calls per month. Today, we‚Äôre excited to announce that Warrant is officially
open source
! ‚≠êÔ∏è
The Problem
Developers, we‚Äôve all been there. What started as a simple
isAdmin
flag to distinguish between internal and external users ‚Äî just so you could release that
one
internal-only feature ‚Äî has grown into a nightmare to maintain. It‚Äôs now a hodgepodge of booleans, database flags, and a halfway built role based access control system that not only slows down your team‚Äôs day-to-day development velocity, but also opens up your company to a slew of
costly security vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited
.
What‚Äôs more? Your customers are now requesting the ability to self-manage their team‚Äôs roles and permissions, so you‚Äôll be spending another 1-2 months building the APIs, UIs, etc. for this risky, non-differentiating feature.
In short, application authorization and access control is difficult to build and even trickier to maintain as a company‚Äôs product evolves and its needs change.
The Solution
To help developers quickly build world-class access control, Warrant provides three things:
(1)
A centralized datastore for storing your application‚Äôs authorization policies and related data.
Warrant‚Äôs management dashboard and APIs make it dead-simple to safely modify authorization policies globally or for a single user or tenant in real-time. With Warrant, updating policies for all users as your product changes becomes a breeze.
(2)
A real-time, low latency access control service for enforcing authorization policies in your application at runtime.
With official Warrant SDKs available for the most popular server-side languages and frontend frameworks, checking if a user has access becomes as easy as a call to Warrant‚Äôs
check
method.
(3)
A library of thoughtfully designed, authorization-specific UI components
that help with building self-service permission management flows, granting/denying access to privileged pages/UIs, displaying audit logs to users, and more. These components are
customizable and
permission-aware
, so developers can drop them into any application.
