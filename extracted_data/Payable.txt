Hi everyone, we’re Faza, Gery, and Albert, aka the team behind Payable!
👋 Team
Faza, Gery, and Albert were classmates back in Bandung Institute of Technology, #1 engineering school in Indonesia. We have been friends for almost 7 years and in early 2022, we started building Payable.
Previously, Faza worked at BCG helping enterprises to build their own digital ventures. Gery worked at Shopee Singapore as a Tech Lead, building robust systems at scale handling >1 million QPS. He even managed two PhDs in his team even though he is a bachelor’s graduate. Albert worked at L’Oreal, the biggest beauty company in the world to set up their social commerce business in Indonesia and grew it by 10x.
During his time in L’Oreal, Albert realized how effective it is when beauty advisers sell products directly in WhatsApp, but it’s also very apparent how bad the payment infrastructure is (non-existent, actually). This led us to realize how massive the problem is, and how uniquely qualified we are to help solve it.

Problem
In Indonesia, online commerce is a really big thing, but almost half of those don’t happen on e-commerce sites, but rather they happen on apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Line, etc. Here, the payment infrastructure is basically non-existent. Everyone is still using bank transfers which create a huge pain for sellers because they have to spend hours manually reconciling hundreds of transfers every day. This also hurts the buyer’s experience since they have a very limited range of payment options.
⚡️ Meet Payable
There are actually a number of existing online payment solutions in Indonesia, but all of them are too expensive and too hard to use for these small and medium sellers, hence they are stuck to doing manual bank transfers. But with Payable, we’re providing them with an online payment infrastructure that is 6x cheaper and much easier to use compared to the existing solutions.
⚙️ How it Works
With Payable, sellers can easily create payment links, and send it to their customers via WhatsApp, Instagram, or other chatting apps. Their buyers can open the link and pay with various payment methods. After the payment is done, the seller will instantly get a notification and it’s all reconciled automatically.
🙏 Our Ask
If you know anyone who is selling stuff through WhatsApp or Instagram in Indonesia, we’d love to learn about their use case! Please hit us up at
