Hello! We are Mark, Phil and Amadeo. We are excited to launch

Crypto is Scaling, and Scaling Hurts
Crypto assets now live on hundreds of interoperable networks. As developers, adding new coins is time-consuming and expensive. At the same time, as users, we often get frustrated by poor on-chain depositing experiences that haven’t changed in the last 10 years!
My co-founder Mark and I led the Assets and Networks team at
Blockchain.com
. Our biggest headache was simply trying to keep up with the ever-growing list of protocols and assets our users wanted to deposit. However, adding a new chain to our system took 2-4 weeks of engineering time. Also, we found that as an end-user, unless you know what you’re doing, it’s extremely easy to send money via the wrong network by mistake.

There Should be a Better Way
Map3 flips the problem on its head. Instead of asking our customers to manage hot wallets and the complexity in their backend, we do the hard work for them by allowing users to bridge into networks already supported by our customers.
We Have Three Features
🌉
Native Bridging
: Users can pay in their preferred network. Assets are bridged to your enabled chains seamlessly. No backend changes are required.
🎯
Transaction Detection
: Supercharge surfaces in-flight transactions, delivering a real-time account funding experience. Reduce anxiety for your users.
📱
Wallet and Exchange Integrations
: Connect to top Wallets and Exchanges with a delightful Plaid-like checkout flow. Eliminate unidentified payments.
Use Cases
💸
Money Collection
: Offramp, swap, and crypto invoices providers need to collect specific amounts of Crypto. We help them do that with less room for error across networks.
🛣️
Take Deposits across Networks
: Your App or Dapp can accept deposits across networks. We monitor liquidity on bridges in real time and only offer routes to users if it's affordable.
📈
Improve conversion and funding rates
: by pulling money directly from the sender’s account with a great UX. Whether it’s
Binance.com
or Metamask, Map3 meets users where they are.
