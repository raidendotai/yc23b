Hi, weâ€™re
Lauren
and
Chirag
, the co-founders of
Blaze
, the next-gen community growth tool.
Problem
Companies today are increasingly using community channels like Discord to engage and retain their customers, but companies struggle to quantify the ROI of community efforts, leverage community data in marketing, and manage community channels at scale in an efficient way.
How we help
We help companies who leverage Discord to:
Establish community KPIs and measure community and marketing campaign performance
Understand and segment your members
Monitor community sentiment and extract product feedback
