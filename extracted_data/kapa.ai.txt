TL;DR:
We make it easy for developer-facing companies to
build AI support bots
for their community. Teams at
OpenAI, Airbyte
and
NextJS
use
kapa.ai
to help onboard new users and reduce support.
We’re Finn and Emil, the co-founders of
kapa.ai
. 👋
The challenge:
Software has a discovery problem
For users:
Have you ever struggled to find what you were looking for on a docs site? We have. And so have the
30 million
other developers in the world.
For maintainers
: Have you ever been pulled out of your work to respond to a customer question that could have been answered by your docs? We have. And so have engineers at the
+15,000
developer-facing companies in the world.
The idea to build
kapa.ai
initially came from a friend that runs a developer-facing company complain about the amount of
“read the f’ing manual” questions
they get and how much of their
engineers’ time
that costs.
How we’re solving it:
“ChatGPT” for your docs
We’ve built a full retrieval augmented generation stack that enables developer-facing companies to
ingest any technical sources into an LLM
and expose it to their community where they have questions.
The bread and butter of what we’ve been building is a super scalable and
state-of-the-art crawling infrastructure
to ensure high quality data is kept up to date and compatible with LLMs.
Here are a few examples of how companies are deploying
kapa.ai
:
Langchain:
Discord
bot
in community of 30k devs
Anyscale
:
Docs widget
on website of project with +25k stars
Netlify:
Custom built docs widget on top of
our API
available to their +1 million users
In addition to reducing support, we’re also helping companies
identify gaps in their documentation and products
by analyzing the answers of their
kapa.ai
bot.
Who’s building:
Emil and Finn 👋
We met +6 years ago in London and ended up doing
two master’s degrees together
: (1) Finance at London School of Economics, and (2) Computer Science at Imperial College London.
While building
kapa.ai
, Finn (CTO) leans towards doing most of the engineering, bringing his experience from building low-latency trading systems at Bloomberg, although he also did sales at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Emil (CEO) handles most of the business, bringing his experience as an Engagement Manager at McKinsey & Company, but also ships, which he learnt while building applied AI systems at startups.
The ask:
Want to reduce developer support?
We’d love to help your company deploy a
kapa.ai
bot (takes less than 24hrs!). And we’re always looking to connect with folks at developer-facing companies if you’d be up for making an intro.
