Howdy,
Charles Weill
here! üëãüèº
I‚Äôm the founder of
CreatorML
, a ML-powered web-based tool
and
Chrome Extension that helps YouTube Creators predict which topics, titles, and thumbnails will get the most views before they upload.
For context, prior to June 2022, YouTube paid out over $50B in advertising rev-share to its creators.
The Problem
Success on YouTube is determined by views, yet creators have no way of quantifying the number of views their videos will receive.
To try and uncover the winning formula, many churn through as many videos as possible and quickly burn out.
YouTubers are drowning in analytics data, but only the largest creators can afford to hire data science teams to get actionable insights.
The biggest determinant of success on YouTube is the quality of topics, titles, and thumbnails.
Our Solution:
We developed a proprietary machine learning algorithm that analyzes millions of video datapoints to create a reliable, scalable predictive model.
Our view predictors allows creators to understand how small changes like reducing the character count of a title, or changing the colors of a thumbnail image can make a meaningful difference in video views.
By removing bias when creators select a title and thumbnail, CreatorML ensures long-form videos are objectively packaged to attract and engage the largest audience possible.
While CreatorML is starting with topics, titles and thumbnails, our vision is to create a complete predictive ecosystem that guides creators through every step of the creative process.
The Team
Before founding CreatorML, I was technical lead in applied machine learning at Google Research for 7 years, using deep learning to improve critical algorithms in Cloud AutoML, Ads, Search, and YouTube.
I‚Äôm also a part-time
YouTube Creator
.
I realized that I found a pain point when I began
tweeting about simple analyses of YouTube analytics data
, and many of the biggest YouTubers in the industry began following me.
How You Can Help:

If you‚Äôre a YouTube Creator with over 100,000 subscribers, let‚Äôs connect at

, and I‚Äôll onboard you with a custom view predictor for your channel.
If you‚Äôre not a YouTuber, you should download our
Chrome Extension for YouTube
