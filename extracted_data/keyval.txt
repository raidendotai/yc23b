Hi YC!
We're Ari and Eden, the founders of
Keyval
.
Odigos, our open-source project, boosts your existing monitoring tools by automatically generating distributed traces for all your applications within minutes.

The Problem
Distributed traces are the most effective signal to monitor distributed applications, but they are also the most difficult to implement.  Unlike metrics or logs, the real value of distributed tracing occurs only after implementing it across multiple applications successfully.  If just one of your applications does not produce distributed tracing, the entire context propagation is broken and the value of the traces drops significantly.
The Solution
Odigos, our open-source project, helps developers fix production issues faster by boosting existing monitoring tools, and automatically providing them with distributed traces, within minutes.
A quick installation scans and recognizes all your applications, auto-instruments them, and deploys the required collectors. This is all done automatically - all you need to do is:
Select your target applications
Select a backend you want to send the information to
That’s it!
Why developers choose to work with Odigos:
✨
Immediately and automatically
get distributed traces for newly-deployed application
🏆
Eliminate blind spots
! Gain confidence and understand what is (and what isn’t) covered by your existing monitoring tools
🚀
Ease of use
– one-step installation completed within minutes
⚖️ Auto-scaled collectors/agents
- deployed and scaled according to the amount of traffic generated by your applications
