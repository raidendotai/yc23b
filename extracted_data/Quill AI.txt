TLDR:
We let investors a) extract information from SEC filings just by asking, and b) screen stocks much faster. If you have friends in finance who want to get more sleep this week, send them to
quillai.co
!
Quill AI lets you search through SEC filings and screen stocks on command. And we don’t just summarize the information - we point you right to the source, making it easy to audit the results.
The Problem(s)
Investors spend hours reading SEC filings looking for key bits of information to use in their models/reports.
Existing AI info extraction tools don’t cite sources very well - making them difficult to audit. They also aren’t tuned for financial filings.
Current stock screeners require an annoying filtering process to produce meaningful lists of investment opportunities.
The Solution
Quill’s web app, which lets you search for key pieces of information across financial documents in Q&A format.
Quill’s natural language screener, which lets you ask for stocks matching your desired criteria.
