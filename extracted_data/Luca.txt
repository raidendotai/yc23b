tl;dr
Luca is a machine learning-powered co-pilot for retail, which constantly identifies headroom in your store, makes recommendations for price adjustments, and helps you manage decisions across all sales channels.
We are an ex-Uber Pricing team that is already helping retailers manage prices for over $50mill of revenue.

Our Story
We are Yonah Mann and Tanvi Surti. We met while working at Uber, where we both worked on pricing technology. Our work cumulatively created over $1 billion in margin gains for Uber – and this experience made us realize that configurable revenue tools in the hands of operators could be incredibly powerful!
So, we are now on a mission to bring revenue optimization tools to retail, and build a fun company as we go along!
The Problem
E-commerce teams have to react to large swathes of data from multiple channels to build a pricing and discount strategy, such as  –
⛅ Seasonal and Market trends, with changing customer price elasticities
👯 Competitor price changes or promotional campaigns
🚛 Inventory availability
🚢 Changing manufacturing and shipping costs
And
, they have to do this across 1000s of SKUs and across multiple stakeholder teams such as Merchandising, Marketing, Revenue, and Inventory. This level of complexity makes changing prices time-consuming and inefficient, while still leaving money on the table.
Our Solution
We replace fragmented decision making in e-commerce teams with our pricing system that organizes, recommends and measures outcomes, ensuring that every product is priced in a way that optimizes revenue and profits. Here’s how –
👀 Observe:
We connect with the customer’s sales and inventory data sources (Amazon and Shopify to start, more to come soon), and create a real-time view of customer elasticities and conversion rates.
👉 Recommend
: We feed historical sales, competitor and market data into our machine learning model, combine it with inventory availability and make recommendations for price and discount adjustments.
🖐 Act:
We bubble up the recommendations over email and Slack, allowing the business to quickly act upon the data and push the changes to production across all their channels.
⚙ Configure
: Lastly, we allow the business to configure custom rules, such as competitor-based pricing guardrails or wholesale-price-based constraints.
