TLDR: Elto dials up to 6 prospects at once, detects when a human picks up, and immediately drops the user into the call. Spend less time waiting on dial tones and voicemail, and more time on the phone with engaged prospects.
Hey everyone,
We’re Jagath and Vignesh, and we’re building Elto. Elto is an AI-powered parallel dialer that makes cold-calling
way
less painful and more productive.
The Problem
Cold-calling
sucks
. Sitting through dozens of dial-tones and voicemail inboxes can be exhausting and demoralizing, and while getting on the phone with an engaged prospect can be magical, it’s easy to go through multiple
days
without a productive conversation. With a 3% pickup rate, for example, it can take
2 hours
of dialing to get a prospect on the phone (let alone a prospect who converts!).
The solution
: Elto
dials 6+ contacts in parallel, detects when someone answers, and connects the pickup to the user.
The rest of the calls disconnect immediately, so they can be re-dialed later.
Using Elto increases the number of engaged leads on the phone in a single calling session by an
order of magnitude
. It also integrates seamlessly with your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.) and/or SEP (
Apollo.io
, Salesloft, Outreach, etc.), so you can import contact lists/sequences/due call tasks and write call recordings, transcriptions, and dispositions back to your platform of choice.
