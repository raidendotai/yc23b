Why are we building it?
From drafting to grant, a worldwide patent costs $60K on average and can take years to obtain. If the patent is contentious, then costs can get much higher ($100K-1M+). It's a slow, complicated, and expensive process which can block innovation and delay time-to-market.
There's a need for software solutions which can make the patenting process more efficient.
Most existing intellectual property software focuses on
search
(finding related technology). However, the
generative
steps of drafting a patent and responding to examiners and competitors make up 90%+ of the costs.
Enter AI, which now has the ability to help with generative patent tasks. At Solve Intelligence, we have assembled a world-class team of AI researchers and software developers. Our goal? To leverage and build on recent AI breakthroughs to transform the patenting process.
Who are we building for?
Our product is for any tech company or inventor striving for swift, high-quality patents at below-market rates. Itâ€™s also a valuable tool for patent law firms looking to increase their bandwidth, engage more personally with their clients, and ensure that the patents they file are of high quality.
