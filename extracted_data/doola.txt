Hey everyone! 👋
We’re so excited to share the launch of
doola Banking
! 🏦
doola
helps global entrepreneurs form U.S. LLCs and DAO LLCs by supporting customers through the incorporation process so they can confidently collect payments, build credibility, stay legal, and make more money.
To date, doola has provided company formation, an EIN, a U.S. address, access to U.S. payments, tax consultations, U.S. tax support, $50,000 in startup perks, and today…
… access to a US business bank account.
We’re essentially enabling a new way for LLCs to bank and build credit in the US.
Our strategy is to deliver a seamless experience to help businesses on their path to growth. We’re engaging our customers with personalized insights, timely recommendations, cash management, team management, account tracking, and financial content, all to optimize daily financial operations — using the superpowers of a feature-rich digital bank.
We are now an all-in-one platform to:
🗂 Register your US LLC or DAO LLC
🏦 Open your US bank account
✅ Keep your LLC compliant with Total Compliance (State Filings, IRS Filings, and Bookkeeping).
All. In. One. Go. No US SSN required.
We’re excited to continue empowering founders across the globe to turn their dream idea into their dream US business.
