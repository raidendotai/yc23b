Hi YC! Vickie, Jeff, and I (Ruoni) are excited to introduce
OpenSight
!
Tl;dr
: OpenSight is a customer support automation tool that resolves
>70% of your customers’ questions
by automating actions in addition to providing text-based responses.
❌ The Problem
You are a B2C SaaS, e-Commerce, Marketplace, FinTech company with tons of tickets growing every day, support is becoming really expensive and
your Intercom bot solves 30% of the tickets
after either you or your head of ops
spent hundreds of hours finding and creating examples to train the bot.
(A notable portion of which are customers who just rage quit and counted as contained)
✨ Our Solution
Automatic Answering Bot
Learn from your FAQ, past agent responses AND agent actions to
2-3x your current chatbot’s containment to 70 - 90%
Give your customer
precise answers
to the question asked (
