Hi everyone 👋, we´re
Eric
and
JC
from
Holacasa
.
The problem
Getting a mortgage is too slow. Working in the Real Estate and mortgage industry, we discovered that most failed transactions happen because the homebuyer didn’t get their mortgage approval fast enough. Additionally, most real estate firms don’t have any tech solutions for their business.
The solution
Holacasa provides real estate firms and developers a white-label, no-code platform and API that helps their clients prequalify and apply for their mortgage quickly and easily, comparing over 10 banks in one place.
How it works
Real estate firms get access to our free platform, which helps their clients get an instant quote, prequalify, and apply for their mortgage quickly and easily with a white-label solution. This also allows real estate firms to have dashboards, real-time status updates, and rankings of their potential leads.
Our ask
If you’re interested in getting a mortgage loan in Mexico, are a proptech, or know any Real Estate firms that could be interested in our free platform, please let us know or email us at
