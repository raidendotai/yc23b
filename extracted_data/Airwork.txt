Hey everyone, ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m
Gary
, the founder of
Airwork
. Weâ€™re a team of 5 building a marketplace to solve Canadaâ€™s labour shortage and give everyone the power to work on their own terms.
Problem: Canadian businesses are struggling with staffing
In Q4 of 2022, 36.9% of all Canadian businesses experienced difficulties hiring skilled labourers, led by construction (49.5%), manufacturing (47.4%), and food services (46.3%). We spoke to over 100 companies, and more than half have experienced one of these within the last 90 days:
ðŸ‘Ž Candidate doesnâ€™t show up to interview
ðŸ‘Ž Candidate signs offer but doesnâ€™t show up on the first day
ðŸ‘Ž Employee quit without notice
ðŸ‘Ž Employee consistently shows up late or leaves early
ðŸ‘Ž Skilled labour positions go unfilled for months due to lack of applicants
ðŸŽ‰ Solution: Airwork ðŸŽ‰
Airwork is an on-demand labour marketplace that lets managers book vetted workers online within minutes. We spent the last year building in private beta and are now launching in
public beta
! ðŸ’ª ðŸš€ ðŸ“ˆ
Airworkâ€™s vetting process involves a resume screen, attendance test, background check, and video interview. As a result, out of tens of thousands of applicants, only the top 5% are selected.
Weâ€™re live the Greater Toronto Area, just expanded to all of Southern Ontario, and plan to expand across Canada.
To date, Airworkers have filled skilled and general roles for:
1. Manufacturing plants
2. Warehouses and logistics companies
3. Construction companies
4. Events, conferences, and weddings
5. Commercial cleaning and facility services
6. Commercial printing
Workers can download Airwork on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and apply to become an Airworker. Airworkers can book shifts nearby and get paid within the same day.
Our business portal also enables managers to create shifts, manage rosters, trigger backfills, and track time sheets all in one place. We also automate administrative and compliance complexities, reducing the overhead of workforce management:
âœ… WSIB insurance coverage
âœ… RCMP-backed criminal record checks
âœ… Payroll and time-tracking
âœ… Automated backfilling
