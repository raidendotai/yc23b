Hi, we’re
Chirag
and
Karan
, founders of
Flex Wash
, based in Temecula CA. We have decades of software development experience and ran a car wash ourselves.
Flex Wash is an operating system for the car wash industry. We help owners manage their operations and grow their revenue.
Car washing is an industry no one ever thinks about, especially software companies. But they should! This is a $15B industry that is rapidly evolving with publicly traded companies and franchises entering the space for the first time in history.
The Problem
Car washes have complex technology needs beyond just normal retail
🚗 License plate recognition and tracking
💰 Monthly subscription management
🧑 Customer retargeting
⚙️ Complex maintenance for equipment that costs up to $1M
Current solutions in this space are
💲 Costly, charge big upfront fees for custom hardware (up to $100K)
📟 Out of date, require ancient versions of Windows on-premise servers
🩼 Inflexible, software is sold in static licenses rather than as a service
The Solution
We offer car wash operators a system that is:
😺 Affordable, just a monthly SaaS fee
📱 Compatible with generic hardware (< $700)
☁️ Runs in the cloud, operators can focus on car washing, not servers
💰 Modern, we use vehicle wash history to funnel customers to high-margin subscriptions
We know this because we ran a car wash ourselves. We faced these issues first hand and that is why we got together to build FlexWash. Our solution not only saves operators money but helps them better manage operations and boost revenue.
