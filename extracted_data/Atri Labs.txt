🤕 Problem
Current Python web frameworks are not suited for creating frontend with 2023 web UI standards. As a result, developers spend years learning JavaScript and React.
💃 Solution
Atri framework enables Python developers to do full-stack development without learning a new language.
Build frontend using a Webflow-like visual builder
When a user interacts with the application such as clicks on a button, the Python backend is triggered to handle the interaction.
These apps can be deployed at Atri cloud or AWS, etc. using a single click.
Python developers choose Atri to keep their tech stack lean and build beautiful web apps quickly.
