Cyclone is an instant coding playground for documentation sites.
🤘
Try it out! No code change needed.
See a preview of Cyclone
embedded on your docs site.
Just provide two links:
your documentation site
an example code repository that showcases your product
If you don’t have an example repo, you can still preview! Just click “Generate example code for me” and we will help you write an amazing sample project 🙂

If you’re building a developer-centric product, please reach out at
haoyang@usecyclone.dev
. We would love to help you make your docs interactive, and fun!
If you’re a developer, try using Cyclone for prototyping! Generate a preview for your favorite library (the example project can be the one you’re working on), and let us know your experience :)

Problem - everyone wants interactive docs but it’s too much work
If you are building a product for developers, you know your docs are critical marketing materials. The best documentation sites (e.g. Stripe) are interactive and let developers quickly try out a product. Why don’t you have a docs site as interactive as Stripe’s? These are two common reasons.
Significant efforts to set up
: Custom interactive features need to be designed and built for your docs site, and you don’t have the time to do it.
Hard to keep the docs up to date with the product
: Startups evolve their product quickly. Maintaining interactive features requires more work than one-time setup.

Solution - a coding playground that goes live on docs in 10 minutes
Here is how Cyclone works:
Provide your docs site URL and a GitHub repo of example project.
Cyclone uses LLM to understand your docs and link each section to code snippets in the example project.
Cyclone gives you a preview of your docs site that has Cyclone coding playground embedded. When viewing each doc section, Cyclone shows you the most relevant code from the example project.
If you like what you see, point your docs site’s DNS record to Cyclone. You are live!
You can continue updating your docs and GitHub repo. Cyclone will automatically keep things up-to-date.

How is Cyclone different from Replit / CodeSandbox …?
Cyclone is built to be embedded on docs sites. This means:
Developers don’t need to switch between your docs and another tool, so they can stay in the flow and are less likely to drop off.
Cyclone is context-aware: it knows what developers are looking at, so it can display relevant code pieces as developers scroll.
Cyclone also makes maintaining the interactive experience hassle-free! It automatically keeps the mapping between docs and code examples up to date. No more dealing with outdated code snippets and sandboxes.
