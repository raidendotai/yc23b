TL;DR:
OpenNext is an open-source serverless adapter for Next.js. You can use it to deploy Next.js 13 apps to your AWS account.
Hi all! Today we are launching OpenNext â€”
https://open-next.js.org
. An open-source serverless adapter for Next.js. It allows you to deploy Next.js apps
serverlessly
outside of Vercel.

Problem
Even though Next.js is designed to run in a serverless environment and does on Vercel; they make it really hard to self-host Next.js with serverless. It requires you to reverse engineer how Vercel does things internally. There have been many attempts to fix this. But most of these projects have either failed or have ended up as closed source paid services that are often buggy.

How it works
So we decided to bring the community together and build an open-source serverless adapter for Next.js.
OpenNext works by running
next build
and transforming the output to a format that can be deployed to AWS.
