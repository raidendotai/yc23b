Hey Fam! 👋
I am
@Idan Shahar
and together with
@Itai Peri
we founded
Allero
.
📣 TL;DR
We scanned public repositories of FreeCodeCamp, Medium, Supabase, Posthog, and many more. Guess what we found out?!
Allero
is an open source (
https://github.com/allero-io/allero
) CLI policy enforcement tool that protects your production CI/CD pipeline. CI/CD pipelines tend to be messy, and there are so many variations of pipeline manifests spread across different repositories. This makes it difficult to ensure security, code quality, and compliance standards are in place in every pipeline.
By running Allero, you can easily reveal and prevent problematic pipelines across multiple organizations and repositories.🏁
👩🏽‍💻Who is it for
You are a DevOps engineer or a platform engineer responsible for CI/CD pipelines in your company. You have at least a few dozen pipelines, and they are complex as hell! You obviously spend so much time managing and maintaining them, which is a total nightmare. Why? because you need to ensure that the code they deliver is bug-free, not vulnerable, scalable, and ready for production.
We already found many problematic pipelines in open-source projects, and we are 100% sure there are many of them out there!
Medium
- When using npm in CI, in order to avoid surprises in dependencies’ versions, you should always use
npm ci
instead of
npm install
Supabase
- When using
npm ci
/
npm install
without
--ignore-scripts
- you risk running unknown scripts injected by your dependencies - which may be malicious.
