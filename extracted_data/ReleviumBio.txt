ReleviumBio
has developed a first-of-a-kind  injectable biopharmaceutical for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA).
The problem:
Knee osteoarthritis is a painful and incurable disease that affects millions of people worldwide, yet there has been no disruptive breakthroughs in treatment care in over 50 years, leaving patients heavily reliant on damaging oral medication. The shortcomings of the current injectable treatments leave 2 million US patients reliant on opioids for adequate pain relief. The number one KOA patient complaint is pain, with regenerative therapies to date failing to demonstrate a measurable patient outcome.
Our solution:
PeptiFlex is the first injectable therapeutic developed for KOA that gives not only pain relief but also lubricates, and protects the joint.
PeptiFlex is a platform treatment that can be applied to treat other joints affected by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.
Who are are:
Alison and Barry co founders joined forces whilst working at the National University of Galway, Ireland. The partnership was a natural fit with Alison having a strong background in the development and commercialization of life science products, and Dr Barry McDermott having expertise in pharmaceutical development from initial conception up to clinical trial design.
