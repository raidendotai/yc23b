TLDR: Floworks helps sales teams close more deals and stay on top of leads by bringing their CRMs over Slack. For example, after an important sales meeting, a rep can post the summary via slack instead of waiting to get back to their desk to log into Salesforce or HubSpot.
ðŸ¤”
The Problem:
20% of every salesperson's time is spent doing CRM updates, follow-ups, and administrative tasks.
This time could have been spent doing actual sales.
Even after investing such time and effort in CRM, have you ever wondered
how many crucial follow-ups did your team miss last week?
how many valuable contacts never converted into opportunities?
how many lucrative deals slipped through the cracks because of neglected logs and updates?
ðŸ‘¤Who is it for:
Every B2B companies starting with 2 person sales team (like founder led sales)Â  to 100 and beyond.
ðŸ˜Š
The Solution:
Sales teams today live and breathe on Slack. Floworks brings your entire CRM on top of Slack.
It does so by integrating your existing CRMs like Salesforce, HubSpot and Pipedrive with your Slack workspace.
