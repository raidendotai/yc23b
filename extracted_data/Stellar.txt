👋 We’re
Angela
,
Elise
and
Quan
, the co-founders of
Stellar
! We were early hires at multiple unicorns and saw OKRs both fail and succeed. The orgs that get it right are those that act quickly and adapt to new information consistently over time.
Stellar is a goal tracking platform focused on agile communication so your team has a fighting chance of hitting their OKRs.
The problem with OKRs
Setting business goals is easy, but iterative execution is hard.
Too many companies set OKRs, forget them in an isolated document and then realize they haven’t made sufficient progress. When OKRs aren’t reassessed openly on a recurring basis, you miss the opportunity to motivate your team, collaborate and unblock progress together.
The designated responsible person (usually a founder or Chief of Staff) spends hours a week running this process, when they could be working on strategic work.
Achieve your goals with confidence
If you’re ready to embed OKRs and agile collaboration in your organization, Stellar will help you:
Stay focused and organized by linking your goals in an OKR tree
Raise and remove blockers quickly through effective, asynchronous check-ins
Save time with scheduled notifications and automatic reminders about missing updates
