tl;dr:
Reworkd AI connects businesses to AI Agent automation. With an easy-to-use, no-code platform, Reworkd AI allows companies to eliminate tedious, repetitive tasks and accelerate their operations with AI Agents, all while integrating seamlessly with their existing tech stack.
Hello folks üëã¬†We‚Äôre the team behind Reworkd AI.
Initially our team developed AgentGPT, a web based platform for AI Agents which quickly attracted
150K monthly active users
and
25K ‚≠êÔ∏è on GitHub
in the last three months.
As we built out this platform, we noticed a growing trend: businesses were increasingly seeking automation through AI Agents.
‚ùå The Problem
Today, the core of many business are comprised of
tasks that require time consuming and manual human intervention
. With the rise of AI Agents, many companies are turning to them to automate these processes in a way that existing workflow tools cannot. In building AgentGPT however, we realized that AI Agents could not handle business-critical processes due to the following problems:
Hallucination:
AI Agents make up information not grounded in any facts.
Unproductive loops/repetition:
AI Agents struggle to understand the current context of a task, leading to unproductive loops.
Probability of failure:
Each prompt completion has a certain probability of failure which only compounds with long-running agents.

Our Solution
Our platform solves these issues by
coupling AI Agents with a structured workflow system
. This enables businesses to formalize and codify their core processes in a verifiably correct way while still enabling AI Agents to reason about the nuances of a problem.
As an example, one B2B customer in our pilot program vends data to over 30,000 different customers. They‚Äôve leveraged Reworkd to create a workflow that runs an AI Agent through each customer‚Äôs website, validating that they are compliant against a set of unstructured rules. Based on these results, the platform will automatically follow up with their customer. This process previously took
an entire department and weeks of manual intervention.
Leveraging our platform, they‚Äôve automated this process to only take a few hours.
