TL;DR: Our AI assistant summarizes legal documents, lets users ask follow-up questions, and generates reliable answers. For example, legal teams at Volkswagen and N26 use our AI assistant to summarize thousands of documents, and get legal insights.
Hello world, we are Roman and Maurice, two AI safety nerds committed to building helpful and honest AI assistants for high-stakes decisions.
üí¨ The Problem
LLMs lie; your legal team should not. To avoid errors, corporate counsel have become excessively dependent on external law firms, which eat up half their budget. Water-tight legal research is tedious; on average, legal professionals spend 5 hours reviewing 45 documents to answer a single question.
‚è© The Solution
We enable legal departments to reliably answer questions for their business. Submit a legal query to Atla for concise insights from credible sources, tailored to your context. Atla‚Äôs AI research assistant sifts through thousands of pages of legalese to empower in-house lawyers to conduct research in seconds.
üé• Our Product
1. Enter a legal question, e.g. What are the legal requirements for implementing a remote work policy for employees?
2. Investigate relevant sources
3. Receive reliable answers
‚≠ê¬†Our Ask
We're seeking to add partners to include in our private beta alongside N26 and Volkswagen. If you know in-house legal professionals working at large enterprises in Europe, please drop us a note at

Many thanks for your support!
