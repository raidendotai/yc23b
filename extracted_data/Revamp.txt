⏳ TL;DR:
Revamp helps eCommerce brands and agencies understand customer behavior by creating smarter segments for targeted email and paid acquisition campaigns.
😣 What’s the problem?
Email marketers and paid media buyers struggle to understand customer behavior because:
eCommerce data is fragmented across many platforms
Most brands and agencies are non-technical and struggle to stitch data together
Even if they stitch the data, analyzing it and acting on it is a struggle
As a result, email marketers default to generic customer segments and media buyers resort to using the bare minimum in their acquisition campaigns.
This translates to millions of unpersonalized emails sent every day and millions of dollars in wasted ad spend on mediocre customer segments.
👕 Why are we solving this?
We’re
Amin Akhtar
and
Stephen Campbell.
We’ve been friends for years and will be co-founders for many more to come!
Let me (Amin) tell you the story of how we got here 🙂
As Chief Revenue Officer of a bootstrapped D2C brand, I found myself spending time I didn’t have wrangling customer data across an ever-expanding tech stack.
As a result, I, like most D2C marketers, resorted to using basic customer segments like “purchased in the last 30 days” in campaigns – that too without really knowing anything about their behavior besides the obvious.
The outcome? Declining revenue from over email and dropping conversion across paid acquisition campaigns that kept me up at night.
To solve my problem I built a prototype (read: series of massive spreadsheets) to create better segments which drove a near-instant 5% increase in revenue from email campaigns + improved performance on the acquisition side.
After hearing my pain points for (at least) the hundredth time, Stephen decided to partner up with me and we got to building. Now we’re actively realizing our vision of a better future for eCommerce retention.
🔎 How are we solving it?
Revamp intelligently stitches data across Klaviyo and Shopify, automatically creates valuable customer segments and calculates metrics and insights specific to that segment.
We then give users the ability to flexibly analyze data and observe differences in behavior in seconds - a task that would’ve taken them days if not weeks to do without it!
Finally, users can push our segments to Klaviyo with one click and Revamp does the heavy lifting of making sure everything’s synced up!
