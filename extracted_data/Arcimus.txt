Tl;dr:
Arcimus (YC S23) is a free AI bot that joins your meetings and takes notes, letting you focus solely on your meeting.
Hey y’all! We’re Hussein and Omar from Arcimus
🗑️ PROBLEM
Corporate communication has been broken for a long time.
There is a lot of information that is lost once a meeting ends. Information that would be relevant to you and people across your organization, like relevant POCs, duplicated work, and product feedback.
✅
OUR SOLUTION
Arcimus will attend your meeting, take notes, and let you search through the notes.
Arcimus lets you choose what you want captured from the meeting via an outline.
Arcimus runs natively in your favorite note taking application.
How it works ⚙️
Create an outline in Arcimus:
Add it to your meetings
The bot will join and listen to the meeting. Once the meeting ends, notes will be generated in your google docs
See and search for your meeting notes
