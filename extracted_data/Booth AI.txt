Hi YC 👋
High quality product photography is a must for E-Commerce stores, but it gets costly fast - with an average of $300/SKU for new photography. That’s why
Ian
and
I
started
Booth.ai
to make quality product photography scalable and accessible to sellers of all sizes.
🔥 TL;DR
Booth.ai
is your personal product photographer, powered by Generative AI. Just describe your photoshoot in text, and we’ll place your product naturally in the generated scene.
🧠 How does it work?
Booth.ai
’s core technology is built on top of Stable Diffusion’s foundation model, plus some fine tuning, and a custom computer vision pipeline. We make this incredible technology accessible and easy to use. Customers connect their Shopify stores to auto-import all of their products. Then they describe, in text, how they want their product to appear.
Booth.ai
handles the rest by generating a scene around the product and producing a 4k image. We even support bulk image generation for stores with thousands of SKUs.
🛍️ Who is
Booth.ai
for?
Our ideal customer profile is an e-commerce business that sells a physical product, and currently spends > $10k yearly on visual imagery. This includes e-commerce aggregators, independent stores on Shopify, WooCommerce, Magenta, FBA, and larger brands with SKU counts that eclipse their photography budgets.
