Ever forget to follow up on something you promised during a meeting? We can do it automatically for you, freeing up your mind and time.

Our Solution
Sidenote
takes the burden of remembering todos off your shoulders by analyzing your notes, detecting your action items, and completing them. Currently, we can:
📅 Create a follow-up meeting for next week
🗒️ Assign a task to design team in project management software
✉️ Draft an email to the project team with the new deadlines
🔔 Add a todo to finish my proposal

What’s Next?
Starting with meetings, we envision Sidenote becoming your work copilot, automating all repetitive parts of your personal work. This means integrating with more platforms and allowing users to create custom automated actions for unique workflows. Request a specific automation
