Hi all!
We’re Vedant & Paras Rajput, the founders of
Shelf
!
Shelf is a Neobank for Young Professionals in India. Instead of using four different apps for Banking, Payments, Expense Management & Bill Splitting, users can keep and manage their money on Shelf, and pay anywhere effortlessly.
🚨The Problem:
70% of the expenses made by Young Professionals are Shared!
People in the early stages of their career usually shift to the tier 1 & 2 cities of India where their companies are based. In these cities, they live with their friends in shared apartments and have a lot of common expenses such as → Rent, House-Help, Cook, Groceries, Online Food Ordering, Entertainment, Travel, and Utilities just to name a few. There are also a lot of alluring activities that they partake in with their friends & colleagues which just adds up to a big amount at the end of the month.
In all these scenarios there is usually only one person who pays, then he/she tracks/splits the amount, then constantly asks for their money back (only to get it back after 2 months), and in the entire duration they suffer a dent which disrupts their monthly budget and there is almost negligible savings (Gosh! Even sounds painful).
The current banking system does not understand this!
💡The Solution:
⚡One-Stop Financial App for all the needs of Young Professionals⚡
As a Neobank, Shelf not only caters to your banking & payments needs, but we also help you manage your spending and pay as a group from the getgo! When you’re using Shelf, you need not have 4 different apps for banking, payments, tracking expenses, and splitting bills, you can just keep your money on Shelf and pay anywhere with a simple slide.
