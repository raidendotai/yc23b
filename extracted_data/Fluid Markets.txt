We’re excited to share what we’re working on here at Fluid!
We're launching a futures exchange to enable
direct investments in the components that influence stock prices, without taking any market risk
. For example,
invest in earnings
of a public company,
but not the equity
itself.
❌ Problem:
Investors model out revenue, earnings, segments and other components that determine the value of the underlying company. When quarterly statements are released, an investor's prediction about a component can be
correct
, but they can still
lose money
on the trade. Investors cannot eliminate external risk through current hedging strategies.
✅ Solution:
We're building an exchange to offer
futures on fundamentals of public companies.
Our futures on
revenue, earnings, and segments,
among other fundamentals, guarantee that if an investor's thesis is
correct
, they will
make money.
📚 Our Story:
Ken, Ari, and Ben are experienced entrepreneurs who have worked in derivatives and securitization investment banking at Goldman Sachs and Barclays.
We encountered the problem of trying to trade fundamentals in our personal portfolios based on expectations of segment performance, and through speaking with equity investors, we've discovered it's a bigger problem than we could have imagined.
❓Ask:
If you are or know anyone who is a public equities investor, from hedge fund managers to asset managers, we would love to hear from you! You can reach out to us at
