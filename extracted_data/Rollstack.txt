Storytelling with slides and docs is too cumbersome 😩
Do you find yourself spending excessive amounts of time formatting data, charts, presentations, and documents to make them presentable? Are you challenged collecting data from various sources to create your presentations and docs? And once you finish, you find yourself repeating the same process for each new client, project, the next week, month, or quarter? You are not alone! It takes teams anywhere from a few hours to multiple days to create a single set of slides or visualizations. 50% of professionals create slides weekly. 75% of them reusing the same deck at least once and 30% over 5 times!
Rollstack solves this! 🥁
Rollstack automatically creates and updates presentations and documents using multiple data sources and updates them for you!
With Rollstack, you can easily connect to your favorite data sources - whether BI tools, CRMs, SQL queries, or sheets and set up a scheduled refresh. Rollstack takes care of refreshing your data where you want to present it. Rollstack also saves your formatting and visualizations choices so that you never do the same task again!
Rollstack also allows you to create new versions of the same deck programmatically and to version control.
