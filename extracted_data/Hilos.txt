TL;DR
Easily connect WhatsApp to the systems you already use and automate outbound customer journeys, as well as advanced inbound experiences in a day, not weeks.
The Problem
You want to send an automated message to your client whenever they reach a certain status in your database / CRM?
Or your customers are asking you the same repetitive questions like “what is the status of my delivery”?
If you’ve tried to integrate WhatsApp to the tools you already use, you already know it’s a time sink. Building these integrations takes precious time from your engineering team. Outbound messages don’t show up in your inbox and confuse your team, etc.
How Hilos simplifies your life
The short version is we turn this…
…into this:
Which lets you connect you customer’s answers with anything with our API step 😉
Hilos is the full stack for WhatsApp that allows you to:
Automate outbound campaigns (whether transactional or for marketing) directly via our API, manually or from Hubspot workflows.
Build intelligent conversations that respond your customer’s questions without spending months building. “What is the status of my package”? That’s a 3 step flow that asks for their tracking number, checks it with your API, and returns the result in chat.
And it comes with all the things you need to get started. Access to WhatsApp’s API, a multi agent inbox and a broadcast sender for personalised one off campaigns.
