TL;DR
—
Rootly
helps build a consistent incident response process by automating manual admin work like creating incident channels, inviting responders, copy-pasting postmortem timelines, updating statuspage, tracking action items, and all without leaving Slack.
Trusted by 100’s of the fastest-growing organizations and best ranked on

The Problem
We met at Instacart 🥕 where we worked as the first SRE (
Quentin
) and led product management efforts (
JJ
). As we grew from a $1B to $40B company, we had to scale our infrastructure, teams, and processes to keep up with millions of orders. Unsurprisingly, this led to our fair share of incidents (e.g. checkout issues, platform outages, etc.). Our manual ways of working in Slack, PagerDuty, Datadog, simply weren’t enough. It was chaotic at scale and lacked consistency. Runbook checklists and trying to remember what to do next wasn’t cutting it.
