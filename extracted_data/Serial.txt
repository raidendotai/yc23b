TL;DR
Serial
unifies data from your manufacturing process, enabling engineers to save time and root cause issues immediately.
The Problem
Root-causing manufacturing issues is a painful and time-consuming process that requires collecting and aligning all forms of data - log files, dimensional measurements, supplier reports, images, etc.
These costly problems result in millions of dollars in lost production capacity, scrapped parts or product recalls.
The Solution
A pipeline to collect, parse, clean and structure data from any source on a production line
Models to identify local trends or deviations in data to escalate quality risks in realtime
Single platform to ask any question about your data and immediately get an answer
The Team
We are Waterloo grads with 10+ years of experience in product design and manufacturing quality from Apple, Tesla, and North. We have suffered this problem firsthand and are building the tool we wish we had.
