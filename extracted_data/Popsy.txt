The Story
Hi YC, we’re Miha & Mourad, co-founders of Popsy. 😊👋
I've always had many product ideas. Every idea I pursued started with a frustration that is building a landing page. When I discovered Notion I loved how easy it was to publish something online. But Notion lacks many basic features of a website builder.
We started with a simple tool to turn existing Notion pages into websites. The response was great, but we also quickly realized the limitations of that approach. We took everything we learned from it and built a fully independent website builder.
