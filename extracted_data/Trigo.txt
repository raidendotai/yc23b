Hi! We’re
Sam
&
Abe
, founders of
Trigo
.
TLDR:
Trigo
aggregates
consumer rent history
to help
landlords approve better tenants
and
lenders write more loans
. We have
25x more coverage
than the credit bureaus, and we’ve already consolidated
tens of thousands of rental units
to provide data instantly.
❓ Rent Data is Missing
🏠
Landlords
:
Bad debt & evictions are at all time highs
in the U.S., and landlords need more data for added protection across the
60+ million tenants screened annually
. Applicants with positive rent history are
4x more likely
to pay their rent on-time and in full.
🏦
Lenders
: In 2021, financial institutions including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac added rent payment data to their underwriting models to expand access to credit. Without rent data to input into these models,
lenders are writing 17% fewer loans than they could
. That’s a lot of missed loans across the
300 million consumer loan originations
annually in the U.S.!
❌
No solution exists
to consistently furnish this data to landlords and lenders today. The largest database has only
3% coverage
of rent data.
🔌 Trigo Rent API
Trigo
is a federally regulated
Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA)
that provides this missing rent data set through a
real-time API
and web application. We’ve already consolidated
tens of thousands of rental units
to provide
instant data
. Where we don’t yet have data coverage, we
automate outreach
to landlords.
👋 About Us
We’re repeat founders with consumer data and finance experience across Experian, Citigroup, and Amazon.
Trigo began when Sam pulled his own credit report and realized not one of his landlords over the past decade had reported a single month’s rent payment to the credit bureaus. With a little research, we discovered that
this data has only 3% coverage in the market today
.
Sam met Abe through
YC cofounder matching
(amazing product - 🤝 YC!), and the rest is history.
