ü´† The Problem
Healthy consumer subscription businesses lose 20-40% of their subscribers annually
Think about a subscription you have personally - subscribers are flooded with impersonal and irrelevant information which does not encourage active engagement
CRM teams do not have solutions available to figure out what the subscriber needs right now to make the most out of their subscription
Current AI retention solutions are built for engineers, not commercial people
üí° The Solution
Subsets is The AI retention co-pilot for subscription businesses
We enable CRM teams to understand, engage, and retain subscribers by enabling personalized and proven retention initiatives based on AI. Initiatives that work get automated and run continuously on dynamic subscriber audiences. By knowing what initiatives work across different subscription businesses, Subsets can recommend initiatives that give ROI fast.
Understand, engage, retain by learning from experimentation
Our solution helps leading subscription businesses increase CLV by +20% and extend subscriber lifetime up to 6 months.
