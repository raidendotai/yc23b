Hi everyone! Excited to launch
Dill
ðŸ¤ 
What we do
Dill is a digital invoicing & payments tool for foodservice distributors.
The problem
Foodservice distributors are processing hundreds of invoices each day. Their biggest pain today is late payments. Restaurants often pay late due to missing invoices and proof of delivery. This is because of the way invoicing is done today â€“ itâ€™s still rooted in paper.
The solution
At Dill, weâ€™re bringing the invoicing & payments process online, and weâ€™re built specifically for the unique workflows of the food supply chain. With us, our customers have gotten paid 20% faster and gotten 20 hours per week back on new sales & better customer service.
Our backstory
Iâ€™m a second-time founder, and b2b commerce is my bread and butter. My last startup in b2b commerce was acquired, so this isnâ€™t my first rodeo! I have always been passionate about the food supply chain â€“ I previously was a PM at Yelp and have always been a huge foodie ðŸ˜‹
