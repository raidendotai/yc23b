🔍 What is Chainsight?
Risks are everywhere for web3 users and companies. However, people and companies actually can mitigate their risk by running the risk analysis and checking the identity, the the history of the blockchain addresses they transact with.
Chainsight API is an effective solution to identify the riskiness of the parties you are transacting with and validate the authenticity and credibility of tokens and NFTs you are purchasing.
🧐 How does it work?
We help web3 users and internet companies check whether there is any risk given any crypto address, smart contract, token, NFT, or URL.
The Chainsight Background Checks platform is based on our proprietary database and transaction analytics platform which have been recognized and sponsored by G20, Bank for International Settlements, and used by famous web2 and web3 companies with a total of more than 350 millions end users.
Today, millions of people are scammed and lose their life savings! We believe our API can help web3 users and internet companies avoid scams, leading to a safer and trustworthy world for web2 and web3 users!
