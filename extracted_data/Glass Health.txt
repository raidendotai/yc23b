ü§î PROBLEM
We saw physicians struggling to manage an ever-expanding world of complex clinical information from heterogeneous sources. We also experienced this problem first-hand in the clinical environment. Our friends in medicine had phones and email accounts full of disorganized journal articles, tweets, clinical images, lecture slides. They could not easily reference these important digital assets when needed to enhance their care of patients.
ü©∫ SOLUTION
Glass is a medical knowledge management platform, aka ‚ÄúNotion for doctors.‚Äù Our platform is tailored to how clinicians capture, organize, store, and retrieve medical knowledge.
We‚Äôve created medicine-specific knowledge management features, including:
Schemas, Scripts, and Cases: store content in special page templates tailored to common medical knowledge constructs.
Pearls: capture snippets of clinical knowledge encountered during patient care and later organize them in your notebook.
Linking and Visualizations: easily backlink pages and later view their relationships with medicine-specific visualizations.
Community Library: view and save pages published by others in the Glass Health Community.
Glass AI: draft differential diagnoses and clinical plans using generative AI. (

Team Collaboration (coming soon): track key information about patients in a HIPAA-compliant team collaboration environment.
These features help clinicians bring all medical knowledge assets they encounter throughout their careers into one place. This helps them achieve clinical mastery faster and leverage their ever-growing digital external brains to better care for patients.
