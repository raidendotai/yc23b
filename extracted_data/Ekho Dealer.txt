TL;DR We’re a licensed dealership that vehicle manufacturers can integrate into their websites, enabling them to compliantly sell new vehicles online.
Hi everyone, we’re
Rowan
and
Chris
- the team behind Ekho Dealer!
The problem ❌
It's legally and logistically complex for vehicle manufacturers to sell their vehicles online:
Franchise laws
mandate that new vehicle sales must be made through a licensed dealer
Traditional dealers
lack online sales support and take 20%+ commission
It is illegal
for manufacturers to sell vehicles directly to consumers in most states
In states allowing direct sales
, it’s expensive and difficult to operate compliantly
Our solution 🏁
Ekho Dealer enables manufacturers to
compliantly sell their vehicles online
by making it
easy to integrate
our
licensed dealership
into their websites.
With Ekho Dealer enabled, vehicle buyers are able to select a vehicle on a manufacturer’s website and complete the entire purchase process online in minutes. This includes financing, titling, registering, and scheduling the delivery of their new vehicle (all without visiting a physical dealership).
How it works 🛠️
On the backend, we take care of all the complicated regulatory requirements that come with being a licensed dealer. This includes calculating and collecting sales tax, filing registration/titling forms and fees with the DMV, and complying with lending regulations when providing financing. On the front end, our website integrations leverage our dealer infrastructure to compliantly process vehicle sales.
