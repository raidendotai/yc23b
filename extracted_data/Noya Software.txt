About us
Hi everyone! My cofounder David and I were the Design Tools team at Airbnb, after they acquired our previous design tools startup. We pioneered internal tools and processes that the award-winning Airbnb design team used when designing web and mobile apps.
At Airbnb‚Äôs scale, it made sense to have an in-house design tools team. But we realized that companies of all sizes could benefit from a better design process that‚Äôs tailored to their product, so we created a new tool that brings the benefits of an in-house design tools team to every company.
The Problem
There‚Äôs always a tricky tradeoff between working in
low-fidelity wireframes vs. high-fidelity mockups
when working on a product idea. Working in low-fidelity allows for quick iteration while hammering out the big picture, but people often have a hard time imagining the final product. Because of this, teams frequently jump to high-fidelity and
stop using wireframes too early
, which slows down progress dramatically as they spend an excessive amount of time perfecting unimportant details.
Personally, there have been many times where I‚Äôve needed to create a high-fidelity mockup or a React prototype to really explain my idea to another engineer. I spent hours designing and coding just to communicate the idea, only for it to be scrapped when we changed direction right after.
Our solution: Noya
Noya is a new kind of design tool that provides the advantages of
both
low-fidelity and high-fidelity design.
With Noya, you build your project with wireframes, while the tool automatically generates a high-fidelity output in real time. It works by mapping low-fidelity blocks into high-fidelity design system and React components. We currently support one open-source design system (Chakra UI), but plan to expand with more choices (MUI, etc), including the option to import your company‚Äôs existing design system.
Here‚Äôs a quick demo video:
