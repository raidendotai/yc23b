üëã Hi everyone, we are Naif & Abdulrahman from Sirdab.
TL;DR:
Sirdab makes it easy for businesses to acquire dry, ambient, chilled and frozen warehousing space and hire fleets to move inventory through a single dashboard. Today, we manage over 50 warehouses, totaling 400k square meters of space, in 8 cities in Saudi Arabia.
‚ùå Problem ‚Äì Storing and moving inventory in MENA is challenging
1. Difficulty in finding suitable solutions:
The conventional approach for businesses is to rent, equip, and operate their own warehouses. The available options are often difficult to discover online and frequently surpass the actual space needs for the business, resulting in underutilized facilities. On the other hand, businesses seeking third-party logistics (3PL) services face a similar challenge in locating a reliable and trustworthy partner.
2. Lack of short-term options:
Regardless of whether a business opts to rent its own warehouse or utilize a third-party logistics provider, it will likely be bound by long-term agreements with limited flexibility.
3. Inefficient inventory management:
As businesses grow, managing inventory across multiple locations becomes increasingly complex and inefficient. Unfortunately, many businesses still resort to using spreadsheet-based methods to manage inventory, lacking a clear record of their inbound and outbound transactions.
4. Challenges in inventory distribution:
For both wholesale and store distribution in Saudi, businesses often face the dilemma of either committing to lengthy contracts or operating their own fleets with subpar utilization efficiency.
