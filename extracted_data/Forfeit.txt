tl/dr:
Forfeit is an iOS/Android app that
takes your money if you don’t do what you say you’re going to do
. You must submit photo/timelapse evidence of you completing said habit, which we then manually verify on our end, or we take your money.
Eg, I know there’s a very slim chance I can motivate myself to go to the gym each weekday morning at 6am for the next 4 weeks. I can set a Forfeit to force me to send a photo, inside the gym, each morning at 6am, or lose $20 each time I don’t. It’s pretty much unlimited willpower!
💰Opportunity:
Most people struggle with forming habits, and this is the only thing that truly motivates a subset of these people. We have a very short payback period on our initial ad campaign, and for a while have had a small amount of users that love us and run a lot of their life through our app.
Our ask:
🚀 Procrastinating on your YC launch (like us)?
🧘‍♀️ Want to meditate consistently for the next 30 days?
🏋️ Want to be more consistent in the gym?
✅ Have a load of boring ToDos that you wish you could be forced to grind out in 5hrs?
📈 Absolutely anything you want to force yourself to do, that you can either self-verify or prove with a photo/timelapse?
Give it a try here!
