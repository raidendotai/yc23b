⚡️ The Problem & Our Mission
300 million Indians face some skin/hair issue, and there is only 1 dermatologist available for every 200,000. While large numbers of patients often visit major dermatology clinics in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru from far and wide, it becomes cost-prohibitive and inconvenient to consistently follow up in-person.
Moreover, the acceleration of digital health driven by COVID lockdowns has further demonstrated to physicians and patients alike that a growing number of derma conditions can be treated through a combination of telehealth and a preset number of dermatologist-recommended products.
We are democratizing dermatology in India like never before, condition by condition, and shipping solutions that actually work.
