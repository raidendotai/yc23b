TLDR: Webinars are one of the most effective ways to get leads. Welcome focuses on creating webinars that drive engagement and revenue.
The Problem
Webinars can often be stodgy and un-engaging. Existing tools like On24, Zoom Webinar or GotoWebinar are focused more on registration and analytics than the live experience. As a result, webinar attendees are often left bored.
The Solution
Welcome is a webinar platform with a built in content creation studio. This mean you can add music, videos and useful on-screen overlays to complement your webinar. For example, here is a new feature we recently released that allows you to put on-screen calls to action for your attendees.
