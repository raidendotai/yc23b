Hey guys, I'm Tee from Multis. We're on a mission to provide corporate cards & spending management tools designed specifically for web3 teams. Meet the team!
‚ùå The Problem(s)
Web3 teams have a significant part of their assets in tokens sitting in treasury, but still have business expenses such as travel bills or web hosting that require USD.
Opening up an account on trading apps such as Binance or FTX takes months. Banks don't want to work with web3 startups, leading to funding freezes or never-ending compliance checks.
Many founders end up paying expenses or converting crypto from their own personal banking and exchange accounts. This isn't compliant nor scalable.
