I run a company called
Vahan
(Khosla Ventures backed) where we’re building India’s largest labor marketplace for the gig-economy. I have a Masters in Artificial Intelligence from Columbia University.
Problem
AI startups have massive data annotation needs. Current solutions charge hundreds of dollars
an hour
to fulfill these, basis complexity.
Solution
Vahan has access to a pool of over 6M gig-workers in India. We are able to farm out data annotation tasks to this pool and get them done at
super low costs
(5-10X cheaper based on use case) since these workers are based in India, while guaranteeing high quality.
