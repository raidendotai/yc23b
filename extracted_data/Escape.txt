tl;dr:
Securing GraphQL is hard.
Escape makes it easy for developers to build secure and reliable GraphQL APIs.

Hello everyone, we are Antoine and Tristan, the founding team behind Escape.
🧠
Tristan
(left) previously worked as a
GraphQL Developer
and experienced himself the need for better tooling in this ecosystem. 💪
Antoine
(right) previously worked as a security engineer for the French Government and
Apple
🍎 which led him to the journey of helping developers secure their code.
🛡 Why are we building Escape?
GraphQL has seen exponential growth in the past years and is now used by 20% of all developers. Companies like
Paypal
,
Walmart
,
Twitter
, and
Airbnb
are now all relying on GraphQL APIs for
their
core businesses
.
Yet, we observed that most - as in like
95%
- of GraphQL APIs that exist today are insanely vulnerable to cyberattacks.
The reason is simple: GraphQL has an entirely different structure than traditional APIs like REST.
Existing security tools do not support it, leaving GraphQL developers and organizations completely blind to the security of what they release and
putting their business at risk
.
🎯 Our solution
We aimed to build the GraphQL Security Testing tool that devs would love. As developers ourselves, we think such a tool would
be
fast to run in CI/CD
be super
easy to set up
and maintain
give
relevant results
Existing tools fail at achieving the latter because they rely on brute-forcing API requests. Thus, most requests are blocked at the validation layer, failing to test the actual code.
At Escape,
we developed a new approach called
feedback-driven API exploration
. We crafted a graph traversal algorithm that learns from the API's responses how to generate requests that actually make sense from a business standpoint.

Using this technique, we are able to pass the validation layer and test the code of the application at a deeper level than previous solutions. So far, we have achieved
more than 80% coverage
in most applications without fine-tuning.

In only 6 months, we partnered with
Snyk
and
Postman
, got into the GraphQL foundation, and worked with companies like
Neo4j
and
ArangoDB
.
